  <p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preparation of this work it has been the purpose of the authors
    to present an outline of the salient features of geology, as now
    developed, encumbered as little as possible by technicalities and
    details whose bearings on the general theme are unimportant. In common
    with most writers of text-books on geology, the authors believe that
    the subject is best approached by a study of the forces and processes
    now in operation, and of the results which these forces and processes
    are now bringing about. Such study necessarily involves a consideration
    of the principles which govern the activities of geologic agencies.
    These topics are presented in Volume I, and prepare the way for the
    study of the history of past ages, which is outlined in Volume II.</p>

  <p>The general plan of the work has been determined by the experience of
    the authors as instructors. Little emphasis is laid on the commonly
    recognized subdivisions of the science, such as <i>dynamic geology</i>,
    <i>stratigraphic geology</i>, <i>physiographic geology</i>, etc. The
    treatment proceeds rather from the point of view that the science is a
    unit, that its one theme is <i>the history of the earth</i>, and that
    the discussions of dynamic geology, physiographic geology, etc., apart
    from their historical bearing, lose much of their significance and
    interest. The effort has, therefore, been to emphasize the historical
    element, even in the discussion of special themes, such as the work of
    rivers, the work of snow and ice, and the origin and descent of rocks.
    This does not mean that phases of geology other than historical have
    been neglected, but it means that an effort has been made to give a
    historical cast to all phases of the subject, so far as the topics
    permit.</p>

  <p>Throughout the work the central purpose has been not merely to set
    forth the present status of knowledge, but to present it in such a way
    that the student will be introduced to the methods and spirit of the
    science, led to a sympathetic interest in its progress, and prepared to
    receive intelligently, and to welcome cordially, its future advances.
    Where practicable, the text has been so shaped that the student may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
    follow the steps which have led to present conclusions. To this end
    the working methods of the practical geologist have been implied as
    frequently as practicable. To this end also there has been frankness of
    statement relative to the limitations of knowledge and the uncertainty
    of many tentative conclusions. In these and in other respects, the
    purpose has been to take the student into the fraternity of geologists,
    and to reveal to him the true state of the development of the science,
    giving an accurate and proportionate view of the positive knowledge
    attained, of the problems yet unsolved, or but partially solved, and of
    solutions still to be attained.</p>

  <p>The theoretical and interpretative elements which enter into the
    general conceptions of geology have been freely used, because they
    are regarded as an essential part of the evolution of the science,
    because they often help to clear and complete conceptions, and
    because they stimulate thought. The aim has been, however, to
    characterize hypothetical elements as such, and to avoid confusing the
    interpretations based on hypothesis, with the statements of fact and
    established doctrines. Especial care has been taken to recognize the
    uncertain nature of prevalent interpretations when they are dependent
    on unverified hypotheses, especially if this dependence is likely to be
    overlooked. If this shall seem to give prominence to the hypothetical
    element, it should also be regarded as giving so much the more emphasis
    to that which is really trustworthy, in that it sets forth more frankly
    that which is doubtful. Hypothetical and unsolved problems have been
    treated, so far as practicable, on the multiple basis; that is,
    alternative hypotheses and alternative interpretations are frequently
    presented where knowledge does not warrant positive conclusions.</p>

  <p>In many cases the topics discussed will be found to be presented in
    ways differing widely from those which have become familiar. In some
    cases, fundamentally new conceptions of familiar subjects are involved;
    in others, topics not usually discussed in text-books are stated with
    some fullness; and in still others, the emphasis is laid on points
    which have not commonly been brought into prominence. Whether the
    authors have been wise in departing to this extent from beaten paths,
    the users of the volumes must decide.</p>

  <p>The work is intended primarily for mature students, and is designed to
    furnish the basis for a year’s work in the later part of the college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
    course. By judicious selection of material to be presented and omitted,
    the volumes will be found useful for briefer courses, and by the use of
    the numerous references to the fuller discussions of special treatises,
    they may be made the basis for more extended courses than are commonly
    given in undergraduate work. The attempt has also been made to make the
    volumes readable, in the belief that many persons not in colleges or
    universities will be interested in following a connected account of the
    earth’s history, and of the means by which that history is recorded and
    read. Antecedent elementary courses in geology will not be necessary to
    the use of these volumes, though such courses may be helpful.</p>

  <p>The arrangement of themes adopted is such as to bring to the fore
    processes with which all students are immediately in contact, and
    which are available for study at all seats of learning. The commoner
    geologic agents, such as the atmosphere and running water, have been
    elaborated somewhat more fully than is customary, and the common
    rather than the exceptional phases of the work of these agents have
    been emphasized, both because of their greater importance and their
    universal availability. The text has been so shaped as to suggest field
    work in connection with these topics especially, since work of this
    sort is everywhere possible.</p>

  <p>After the preliminary outline, which is intended to give some idea of
    the scope of the science, and of its salient features, and to show the
    relations of the special subjects which follow, the order of treatment
    is such as to pass from the commoner and more readily apprehended
    portions of the subject to those which are less readily accessible and
    more obscure. Following the same general conception, the treatment of
    the topics is somewhat graded, the earlier chapters being developed
    with greater simplicity and fullness, while the later are somewhat more
    condensed.</p>

  <p>Many acknowledgments are made in the text and foot-notes, but it
    is impossible to adequately acknowledge all the sources which have
    been drawn upon, since the whole body of literature has been laid
    under contribution. The authors especially acknowledge the generous
    assistance of Professor J. P. Iddings in connection with the chapter on
    The Origin and Descent of Rocks; of Dr. F. R. Moulton, Professor C. S.
    Slichter, Professor L. M. Hoskins, Mr. A. C. Lunn, and Mr. W. H. Emmons
    in connection with mathematical problems; of Professor C. R.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> Barnes in
    connection with the geologic functions of life; and of Professor Julius
    Stieglitz in connection with chemical subjects.</p>

  <p>The illustrations have been selected from numerous sources, which are
    usually acknowledged in the text. Especial acknowledgment is due to the
    <abbr title="United States">U.&nbsp;S.</abbr> Geological Survey for the use of numerous photographs and maps,
    and to Mr. G. A. Johnson, who has made many of the drawings reproduced
    in Volume I. The authors are under even larger obligations for
    assistance in the preparation of Volume II, for which acknowledgment
    will be made in the proper place.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subheadc">PRELIMINARY OUTLINE.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Geology</span> treats of the structure of the earth, of the various
    stages through which it has passed, and of the living beings that
    have dwelt upon it, together with the agencies and processes involved
    in the changes it has undergone. <i>Geology is essentially a history
    of the earth and its inhabitants.</i> It is one of the broadest
    of the sciences, and brings under consideration certain phases of
    nearly all the other sciences, particularly those of astronomy,
    physics, chemistry, zoology, and botany. It also embraces the earlier
    expressions of mental development and of life-relationships, chiefly as
    found in the lower animals.</p>

  <p><b>Subdivisions.—</b>Naturally so broad a science has many special
    aspects which constitute subdivisions, in a sense, though they
    are rather dominant phases than independent sections. That phase
    which treats of the outer relations of the earth is <i>Cosmic</i>
    or <i>Astronomic geology</i>; that which treats of the constituent
    parts of the earth and its material is <i>Geognosy</i>, of which the
    most important branch is <i>Petrology</i>, the science of rocks.
    That branch which investigates the structural arrangement of the
    material, or “the architecture of the earth,” is <i>Geotectonic</i>,
    or <i>Structural geology</i>; while that which deals with the surface
    changes and topographic forms, that is, with the face of the earth, is
    <i>Physiographic geology</i>. The study of the fossils that have been
    preserved in the rocks, and of the faunas and floras that these imply,
    constitutes <i>Paleontologic geology</i>, or <i>Paleontology</i>. The
    treatment of the succession of events forms <i>Historical geology</i>.
    This is chiefly worked out by the succession of beds laid down in the
    progress of the ages, which constitutes <i>Stratigraphic geology</i>.
    The treatment of causes, agencies, and processes is the function of
    <i>Dynamic</i> or <i>Philosophic geology</i>.</p>

  <p>Besides these there are special applications which give occasion
    for other terms, as <i>Economic geology</i>, which is concerned
    with the industrial applications of geologic knowledge; <i>Mining
    geology</i>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> is a sub-section of economic geology, relating to
    the application of geologic facts and principles to mining operations;
    <i>Atmospheric geology</i>, <i>Glacial geology</i>, and others that
    define themselves, and are for the greater part but limited aspects of
    the broad science.</p>

  <p><b>Dominant processes.—</b>Three sets of processes, now in operation on
    the surface of the lithosphere, have given rise to most of the details
    of its configuration, and even many of its larger features. These
    processes have been designated <i>diastrophism</i>, <i>vulcanism</i>,
    and <i>gradation</i>. <i>Diastrophism</i> includes all crustal
    movements, whether slow or rapid, gentle or violent, slight or
    extensive. Many parts of the land, especially along coasts, are known
    to be slowly sinking relative to the sea-level, while other parts are
    known to be rising. The fact that rocks originally formed beneath the
    sea now exist at great elevations, and the further fact that areas
    which were once land are now beneath the sea, are sufficient evidence
    that similar changes have taken place in the past. <i>Vulcanism</i>
    includes all processes connected with the extrusion of lava and other
    volcanic products, and with the rise of lava from lower to higher
    levels, even if not extruded. Vulcanism and diastrophism may be closely
    associated, for local movements at least are often associated with
    volcanic eruptions, and more considerable movements may be connected
    with the movements of subsurface lavas, even when the connection
    is not demonstrable. <i>Gradation</i> includes all those processes
    which tend to bring the surface of the lithosphere to a common level.
    Gradational processes belong to two categories—those which level down,
    <i>degradation</i>, and those which level up, <i>aggradation</i>. The
    transportation of material from the land, whether by rain, rivers,
    glaciers, waves, or winds, is <i>degradation</i> and the deposition of
    material, whether on the land or in the sea, is <i>aggradation</i>.
    Degradation affects primarily the protuberances of the lithosphere,
    while aggradation affects primarily its depressions.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Astronomic Geology.</span></h3>

  <p><b>The earth as a planet.—</b>Though supremely important to us, the
    earth is but one of the minor planets attendant upon the sun, and is
    in no very special way distinguished as a planetary body. Of the eight
    planets, four, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are much larger
    than the earth, while three, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, are smaller.
    There are a host of asteroids, but all together they do not equal the
    mass of the smallest planet. The average mass of the eight planets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> is
    more than fifty times that of the earth, while the largest, Jupiter,
    is more than three hundred times as massive as the earth. The earth’s
    position in the group is in no sense distinguished. It is neither
    the outer nor the inner, nor even the middle planet. Even in the
    minor group to which it belongs, it is neither the outermost nor the
    innermost member, though in this group it is the largest. Its average
    distance from the sun is about 92.9 million miles, and this fixes its
    revolution at 365¼ days, for its period of revolution is directly
    dependent on its distance from the sun, and is necessarily longer than
    the revolutions of the inner planets and shorter than those of the
    outer planets. Its rotation in twenty-four hours is not far different
    from that of its neighbor Mars, but is much slower than the more
    distant and larger planets, Jupiter and Saturn, which rotate in about
    ten hours. Comparison cannot be made with the innermost and outermost
    planets, because their rotations are not yet satisfactorily determined.
    The plane of the earth’s revolution lies near the common plane of
    the whole system, but this is not peculiar, as all of the planets
    revolve in nearly the same plane. Only a few of the small asteroids
    depart notably from this common plane. This has an important bearing
    on theories of the origin of the system, since this close coincidence
    of the planes of the orbits is not consistent with any haphazard
    aggregation of the material. Of similar importance is the fact that
    all of the planets revolve in the same direction and in ellipses that
    do not depart widely from circles. The eccentricity of the earth’s
    orbit is only about ¹⁄₆₀. This eccentricity varies somewhat, due to
    the disturbing influences of the other planets, and this variation has
    been regarded by some geologists as an influential cause of climatic
    changes, but its adequacy to produce great effects has been doubted by
    others. The inclination of the earth’s axis, now about 23½°, holds an
    intermediate position, some of the planets having axes more inclined,
    as Saturn, 26⅚°, and others less inclined, as Jupiter, 3°. The
    inclination of the axis is subject to trivial variations at present,
    and in the long periods of the past has possibly changed more notably.
    This possible change has also been thought to be a cause of climatic
    variation, but its efficiency has not been demonstrated.</p>

  <p><b>Its satellite.—</b>The earth is peculiar in having one unusually
    large satellite, which has a mass ¹⁄₈₁ of its own. The great planets
    have several satellites whose combined mass exceeds that of the moon,
    and perhaps in some few cases the individual satellites may be larger
    than the moon, but they do not sustain so large a ratio to their
    planets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> for Titan, probably the largest, is only ¹⁄₄₆₀₀ of the mass
    of Saturn. There is little doubt that the moon has played an important
    part in the history of the earth. It is the chief agency in developing
    oceanic tides, and it possibly also develops a body tide in the earth
    itself. These tides act as a brake on the rotation of the earth and
    tend to reduce its rate, and thereby to lengthen the day. While this
    may have been counteracted in some measure by the shrinkage of the
    earth, which tends to increase its rate of rotation, it has been held
    by eminent physicists and geologists that the rotation of the earth
    has been greatly lessened during its history, and that a long train of
    important consequences has resulted. If the contraction of the earth
    has been sufficient to offset this lessening, the tidal brake must be
    credited with the prevention of the excessive speed of rotation which
    would otherwise have been developed. The tides are efficient agencies
    in the shore wear of the oceans, and in the distribution of marine
    sediments, and these, it will be seen later, are important elements in
    the formation of strata.</p>

  <p><b>Dependence on the sun.—</b>By far the most important external
    relation of the earth, however, is its dependence on the sun. The earth
    is a mere satellite of the sun, less than ¹⁄₃₀₀₀₀₀ of its mass, and
    hence under its full gravitative control. The earth is dependent on the
    sun for nearly all its heat and light, and, through these, for nearly
    all of the activities that have given character to its history. It is
    too much to say that all activities on the surface of the earth are
    solely dependent on those of the sun, for a certain measure of heat and
    light and other energy is derived from other bodies, and a certain not
    inconsiderable source of energy is found in the interior of the earth
    itself; yet all of these are so far subordinate to that great flood of
    energy which comes from the sun that they are quite inconsequential.
    The history of the earth in the past has been intimately dependent upon
    that of the sun, and its future is locked up with the destiny of that
    great luminary. Geology in its broadest phases can therefore scarcely
    be separated from the study of the sun, but this falls within the
    function of the astronomer rather than the geologist.</p>

  <p><b>Meteorites.—</b>There are a multitude of small bodies passing
    through space in varying directions and with varying velocities and
    occasionally encountering the earth, to which they add their substance.
    Some of these meteorites revolve about the sun much as if they were
    minute planets, but some of them come from such directions and with
    such velocities as to show that they do not belong to the solar family.
    Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> consist almost wholly of metal, chiefly iron alloyed with a
    small percent. of nickel (holosiderites); some consist of metal and
    rock intimately mixed (syssiderites and sporadosiderites); and some
    consist wholly of rock (asiderites). The rock is usually composed of
    the heavier basic minerals, though some meteorites consist largely
    of carbonaceous material. Besides meteorites, there is little doubt
    that wandering gaseous particles strike the earth, but this is beyond
    the reach of present demonstration. The amount of substance added to
    the earth by these meteorites and gases in recent times is relatively
    slight compared with the whole body of the earth. What contribution may
    have come to the earth in earlier times from such sources is a matter
    of hypothesis which will be discussed later.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Geognosy.</span></h3>

  <p><b>The constitution of the earth.—</b>Turning from its external
    relations to the earth itself, a natural threefold division is
    presented: (1) the atmosphere, (2) the hydrosphere, and (3) the
    lithosphere.</p>

  <h4><i>I. The Atmosphere.</i></h4>

  <p>The atmosphere is an intimate mixture of (1) all those substances
    that cannot take a liquid or solid state at the temperatures and
    pressures which prevail at the earth’s surface, together with (2) such
    transient vapors as the various substances of the earth throw off. The
    first class form the permanent gases of the atmosphere, and consist
    of nitrogen about 79 parts, oxygen about 21 parts, carbon dioxide
    about .03 part, together with small quantities of argon, neon, xenon,
    krypton, helium, and other rare constituents. The second class are
    the transient and fluctuating constituents of the atmosphere, chief
    among which is aqueous vapor, which varies greatly in amount according
    to temperature, pressure, and other conditions. To this are to be
    added volcanic emanations and a great variety of volatile organic
    substances. Theoretically, every substance, however solid, discharges
    particles which may transiently become constituents of the atmosphere.
    Practically, only a few of these exist in such quantity as to be
    appreciable. Dust and other suspended matter are usually regarded as
    impurities rather than constituents of the atmosphere, but they play a
    not unimportant part by affecting its temperature and luminosity, and
    by facilitating the condensation of moisture.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

  <p><b>Mass and extent.—</b>The total mass of the atmosphere is estimated
    at five quadrillion tons, or ¹⁄₁₂₀₀₀₀₀ of the mass of the earth. It is
    relatively dense at the surface of the earth and decreases in density
    outwards in a manner difficult of absolute determination, so that the
    actual height of the appreciable atmosphere is not positively known.
    The true conception of the atmosphere is perhaps that of a tenuous
    envelope exerting a pressure of about fifteen pounds per square inch
    at the sea-level, and thinning gradually upwards until it reaches a
    tenuity which is inappreciable, but perhaps not ceasing absolutely
    until the sphere of gravitative control of the earth is passed, about
    620,000 miles from the lithosphere. In the lower portion, according to
    the kinetic theory of gases, the molecules fly to and fro, colliding
    with each other with almost inconceivable frequency, and with very
    short paths between successive collisions, but in the upper rare
    portion some of the molecules bound outwards, and do not strike other
    molecules, and hence pursue long elliptical paths until the gravity of
    the earth overcomes their momentum, when they return, perhaps to bound
    off again or to force other molecules to do so. This fountain-like
    nature of the outer part of the atmosphere makes any sharp definition
    of its limit impracticable. Some molecules are believed to be shot away
    at such speed that they do not return. Beyond about 620,000 miles from
    the surface of the lithosphere, the differential attraction of the sun
    is greater than that of the earth, and if the attraction of the earth
    does not turn the molecules back before reaching this distance, they
    are almost certain to be lost to the earth.</p>

  <p>The measurement of heights by the aneroid barometer, which is much used
    in practical geology, is dependent on the lessening of pressure as the
    instrument is carried upward.</p>

  <p><b>Geologic activity.—</b>The atmosphere is the most mobile and active
    of the three great subdivisions of the earth, and when its indirect
    effects through the agency of water, as well as its direct effects,
    are considered, it is to be regarded as one of the most effective
    agencies of change. It acts chemically upon the rock substance of the
    earth, causing induration in some instances, but more often inducing
    disintegration and change of composition by means of which rock is
    reduced to soil, or soil-like material, and rendered susceptible of
    easy removal by winds and waters. When in motion the atmosphere acts
    mechanically on the surface of the earth, transporting dust and sand,
    and by the friction of these it abrades the surface. It is chiefly
    effective, however, in furnishing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> conditions for water action.
    Partly by its mechanical aid, but chiefly by securing the right
    temperature, it is a necessary factor in the action of rains, streams,
    glaciers, and the various forms of moving water upon land. So also,
    on the ocean, wave action is essentially dependent on the winds. In
    the absence of atmospheric propulsion, wave action would be chiefly
    confined to the tides and to occasional earthquake impulses, and would
    lose nearly all its efficiency. Stream action and wave action, which
    are the most declared of the geological agencies, are therefore to be
    credited as much to the atmosphere as to the hydrosphere, since the
    action is a joint one to which both envelopes are essential.</p>

  <p><b>A thermal blanket.—</b>A function of the atmosphere of supreme
    importance is the thermal blanketing of the earth. In its absence the
    heat of the sun would reach the surface with full intensity, and would
    be radiated back from the surface almost as rapidly as received, and
    only a transient heating would result. During the night an intensity
    of cold would intervene scarcely less severe than the temperature of
    space. In penetrating the atmosphere certain portions of the radiant
    energy of the sun are absorbed. Of the remainder which reaches the
    surface of the earth, a part is transformed into vibrations of lower
    intensity, which are then more effectively retained by the atmosphere.
    The air thus distributes and equalizes the temperature. The two
    constituents of the atmosphere which are most efficient in this work
    are aqueous vapor and carbon dioxide, and the climate of the earth is
    believed to have been very greatly affected by the varying amounts of
    these constituents in the atmosphere, as well as by the total mass of
    the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>The function of the atmosphere in sustaining life and promoting all
    that depends on life is too obvious to need comment.</p>

  <p>The special geological action of the atmosphere will be discussed in
    the next chapter.</p>

  <h4><i>II. The Hydrosphere.</i></h4>

  <p>About 1300 quadrillion tons of water lie upon the surface of the solid
    earth. This equals about ¹⁄₄₅₄₀ part of the earth’s mass. Were the
    surface of the solid earth perfectly spheroidal, this would constitute
    a universal ocean somewhat less than two miles deep. Owing to the
    inequalities of the rock surface, the water is chiefly gathered into a
    series of great basins or troughs occupying about three-fourths (72%)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
    of the earth’s surface. These basins are all connected with each other
    and act as a unit, so that anything which changes the level of the
    water in one changes the level of all. This helps to make a common
    record of all great movements of the earth’s body, for the level of
    the ocean determines where the detritus from the land shall lodge, and
    hence where the edge of the marine beds shall be formed. This will
    appear more clearly when the formation of marine strata is discussed.</p>

  <p><b>Oceanic dimensions.—</b>The surface area of the ocean is estimated
    by Murray at 143,259,300 square miles. Of this, somewhat more than
    10,000,000 square miles lie on the continental shelf, i.e., lap up on
    the borders of the continental platforms. This shows that the great
    basins are somewhat more than full. If about 600 feet of the upper
    part of the ocean were removed, the true ocean basins would be just
    full, and the surfaces of the true continental platforms would be dry
    land. The area of the true oceanic basins is about 133,000,000 square
    miles, and that of the true continental platforms about 64,000,000
    square miles. Under about 20% of the ocean area, the bottom sinks
    to depths between 6000 and 12,000 feet; under about 53% it sinks to
    depths between 12,000 and 18,000 feet; and under the remaining 4%
    it ranges from 18,000 feet down to about 30,000. The last includes
    those singular sunken areas known as “deeps,” and sometimes called
    <i>anti-plateaus</i>, as they extend downward from the general ocean
    bottom much as the plateaus protrude upwards from the general land
    surface.</p>

  <p>Besides the ocean, the hydrosphere includes all the water which
    constitutes the surface streams and lakes, together with that which
    permeates the pores and fissures of the outer part of the solid earth;
    but altogether these are small in amount compared with the great ocean
    mass.</p>

  <p><b>Geologic activity.—</b>Of all geological agencies water is the
    most obvious and apparently the greatest, though its efficiency is
    conditioned upon the presence of the atmosphere, upon the relief of
    the land, and upon the radiant energy of the sun. Through the agency
    of rainfall, of surface streams, of underground waters, and of wave
    action, the hydrosphere is constantly modifying the surface of the
    lithosphere, while at the same time it is bearing into the various
    basins the wash of the land and depositing it in stratified beds. It
    thereby becomes the great agency for the degradation of the land and
    the building up of the basin bottoms. It works upon the land partly
    by dissolving soluble portions of the rock substance, and partly by
    mechanical action. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> solution of the soluble part usually loosens
    the insoluble, and renders it an easy prey of the surface waters.
    These transport the loosened material to the valleys and at length to
    the great basins, meanwhile rolling and grinding it and thus reducing
    it to rounder forms and a finer state, until at length it reaches the
    still waters or the low gradients of the basins and comes to rest.
    The hydrosphere is therefore both destructive and constructive in its
    action. As the beds of sediment which it lays down follow one another
    in orderly succession, each later one lying above each earlier one,
    they form a time record. And as relics of the life of each age become
    more or less imbedded in these sediments, they furnish the means of
    following the history of life from age to age. The historical record
    of geology is therefore very largely dependent upon the fact that the
    waters have thus buried in systematic order the successive life of the
    ages. Aside from this, the means of determining the order of events of
    the earth’s history are limited and more or less uncertain.</p>

  <p>The special processes of the hydrosphere in its various phases will
    be the subject of discussion hereafter (<abbr title="Chapters">Chaps.</abbr> <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">IV</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI</a>). Suffice
    it here to recognize its great function in the constant degradation
    of the land, and in the deposition of the derived material in orderly
    succession in the basins.</p>

  <p><b>Chief horizons of activity.—</b>The great horizons of geological
    activity are (1) the contact zone between the atmosphere and the
    hydrosphere, chiefly the surface of the ocean, (2) the contact zone
    between the hydrosphere and the lithosphere, chiefly the shore belts,
    and (3) the contact zone of the atmosphere and surface waters, with the
    face of the continents. It is in these three zones that the greatest
    external work is being done and has been done in all the known ages.</p>

  <h4><i>III. The Lithosphere.</i></h4>

  <p>The atmosphere and hydrosphere are rather envelopes or shells than true
    spheres, though in some degree both penetrate the lithosphere. The
    lithosphere, on the other hand, is a nearly perfect oblate spheroid
    with a polar diameter of 7899.7 miles, and an equatorial diameter of
    about 26.8 miles more. Its equatorial circumference is 24,902 miles,
    its meridional circumference 24,860 miles, its surface area 196,940,700
    square miles, its volume 260,000,000,000 cubic miles, and its average
    specific gravity about 5.57. The oblateness of the spheroid is an
    accommodation to the rotation of the earth, the centrifugal force
    at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> equator being sufficient to cause the specified amount of
    bulging there. Computations seem to indicate that the accommodation
    is very nearly what would take place if the earth were in a liquid
    condition, from which the inference has been drawn that it must have
    been in that condition when it assumed this form, and must have
    continued essentially liquid until it attained its present rate of
    rotation, since, if the earth once rotated at a much higher speed, the
    flattening at the poles and the bulging at the equator must have been
    correspondingly greater. It is thought by others, however, that the
    plasticity of the earth is such that it would at all times assume a
    close degree of approximation to the demands of rotation, even if the
    interior were in a solid condition. By still others it is thought that
    the contraction of the earth has tended to accelerate the rotation
    about as much as the tides have tended to retard it, and that it has
    undergone little change of form.</p>

  <p><b>Irregularities.—</b>It is only in a general view, however, that
    there is a close approximation to a perfect spheroidal surface. In
    detail there are very notable variations from it. Geodetic surveys seem
    to have shown that the equatorial diameters are not all equal, even
    when the measurements are reduced to sea-level, but research along
    this line has not reached a sufficient stage of completeness to permit
    satisfactory discussion. It is, however, highly probable that the
    ocean surface as well as the average land surface is warped out of the
    perfect spheroidal form to some notable degree. This is very likely due
    to inequalities in the density of the earth’s interior. The fact that
    the larger portion of the water is gathered on one side of the globe,
    while the land chiefly protrudes on the opposite side, is very possibly
    due to unequal specific gravity in the interior of the earth.</p>

  <p>The most obvious departure from a spheroidal form is found in the
    protrusion of the continents and in the sinking away of the earth
    surface under the oceans. As these inequalities present themselves
    to-day, they are known as continental platforms and ocean basins. These
    do not correspond accurately with the present land and water surfaces.
    About the continental lands there is a submerged border extending some
    distance out from the shore, and constituting a sea-shelf beyond which
    the surface descends rapidly to the great depths of the ocean. This
    slightly submerged portion, known as the continental shelf, belongs
    as properly to the continent as the adjacent low lands which are not
    submerged. The submergence of the edge of this shelf at present is
    usually about 100 fathoms, so that if the upper 600 feet <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>of the
    ocean were removed, the outlines of the land would correspond quite
    closely with the border of the true continental platform.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>It is customary to look upon the protrusions of the continents as the
    great features of the earth’s surface, but in reality the oceanic
    depressions are the master phenomena. In breadth, depth, and capacity
    they much exceed the continental protrusions, and if the earth be
    regarded as a shrunken body, the settling of the ocean bottoms has
    doubtless constituted its greatest surface movement. From the estimates
    of Murray, Gilbert has derived the following tables, showing the
    relative areas of the lithosphere above, below, and between certain
    levels.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>From these estimates it appears that if the surface were graded to a
    common level by cutting away the continental platforms and dumping the
    matter in the abysmal basins, the average plane would lie somewhere
    near 9000 feet below the sea-level. The continental platform may
    be conceived as rising from this common plane rather than from the
    sea-level.</p>

  <p><b>Epicontinental seas.—</b>Those shallow portions of the sea which lie
    upon the continental shelf, and those portions which extend into the
    interior of the continent with like shallow depths, such as the Baltic
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>Sea and the Hudson Bay, may be called epicontinental seas, for they
    really lie <i>upon</i> the continent, or at least upon the continental
    platform; while those other detached bodies of water which occupy deep
    depressions in the surface are to be regarded as true abysmal seas,
    as, for example, the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas and the Gulf of
    Mexico, whose bottoms are as profound as many parts of the true ocean
    basin itself.</p>

  <p><b>Diversities of surface.—</b>The bottoms of the oceanic basins are
    diversified by broad undulations which range through many thousands
    of feet, but they are not carved into the diversified forms that give
    variety to land surfaces. The ocean bottoms are also diversified by
    volcanic peaks, many of which rise to the surface and constitute
    isolated islands. Some of them have notable platforms at or near the
    surface, cut by the waves or built up by the accumulation of sediment
    and of coralline and other growths about them. Aside from these
    encircling platforms, the solid surface usually shelves rapidly down to
    abysmal depths, so that the islands constitute peaks whose heights and
    slopes would seem extraordinary if the ocean were removed.</p>

  <p>The surface of the land is diversified in a similar way by broad
    undulations and volcanic peaks, and also by narrower wrinklings and
    foldings of the crust; but all of these irregularities have been carved
    into diversified and picturesque forms by subaërial erosion. In this
    respect the surface of the land differs radically from the bed of the
    sea. The agencies which have produced the continental platforms and
    abysmal basins, and the great undulations and foldings, as well as the
    volcanic extrusions that mark them, are yet subjects of debate. Here
    lie some of the most difficult problems of geology, but these cannot be
    stated with sufficient brevity to find a place here.</p>

  <p><b>The surface mantle of the lithosphere.—</b>The surface of the
    lithosphere is very generally mantled by a layer of loose material
    composed of soil, clay, sand, gravel, and broken rock. This loose
    material is sometimes known as <i>mantle rock</i>, and sometimes as
    <i>rock waste</i>. On the land, mantle rock is often composed of the
    disintegrated products of underlying rock formations. It represents the
    results of the recent action of the atmosphere, of water, of changes of
    temperature, and of other physical agencies acting on the outer part of
    the rock sphere. The surface of this mantle is being constantly removed
    by wind and water, but as constantly renewed by continued decomposition
    of the rock below. In some areas, especially in the northern part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> of
    North America and the northwestern part of Europe, the soil graduates
    down into an irregular sheet of mixed clay, sand, gravel, and bowlders,
    known as <i>drift</i>. From this and other evidence it is inferred that
    at a time not greatly antedating our own, ice, chiefly in the form of
    glaciers, spread extensively over the high latitudes of the northern
    hemisphere. In some parts of the earth the surface is still covered by
    fields of snow and ice, comparable to those which formed the drift. In
    still other places, especially along the flood plains of streams, the
    mantle rock consists of deposits made by streams which were unable to
    carry their loads of sediment to the sea.</p>

  <p><b>The crust of the lithosphere.—</b>Much of the detritus washed down
    from the land finds its way to bodies of standing water, and beneath
    lakes and seas the mantle of loose material is made up largely of the
    gravel, sand, and mud derived from the land. Before deposition these
    materials are more or less assorted and arranged in layers by waves
    and currents. When consolidated they constitute rock. The weathering
    of the rocks of the land, the wearing away of the resulting detritus,
    and its deposition beneath standing water, are among the most important
    processes of geologic change.</p>

  <p>On the land, the mantle of loose material is sometimes absent, and
    in such places the surface of solid rock of the crust appears. Bare
    surfaces of rock are most commonly seen where the topography is rough,
    especially on the slopes of steep-sided valleys and mountains, and on
    the slopes of cliffs which face seas or lakes. Solid rock, without
    covering of soil or loose material of any sort, is also frequently seen
    in the channels of streams, especially where there are falls or rapids.</p>

  <p>We have but to note the effects of a vigorous shower on a steep slope,
    or of a swift stream on its channel, or of waves on the cliffs which
    face lakes and seas, to understand at least one of the reasons why
    loose materials are frequently absent from steep slopes. The very
    general exposure of solid rock where conditions favor surface erosion
    suggests that rock is everywhere present beneath the soil or subsoil.
    Fortunately there is an easy way of testing the universality of the
    crust beneath the mantle. In all lands inhabited by civilized peoples
    there are numerous wells and other excavations ranging from a few feet
    to several hundred feet in depth, and occasional wells and mine-shafts
    reach depths of several thousand feet. Even in shallow excavations
    rock is often encountered, and in most regions excavations as much as
    two or three hundred feet deep usually reach rock, and no really deep
    boring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> has ever failed to find it. It may, therefore, be accepted as a
    fact that the upper surface of the solid rock is nowhere far below the
    surface.</p>

  <p>Concerning the thickness of the crust, if there be any true crust
    at all, little is known by direct observation. The deepest valleys,
    such as the canyon of the Colorado, and the shafts and borings of
    the deepest mines and wells, give knowledge of nothing but rock. The
    deepest excavations extend rarely more than a mile below the surface.
    It is certain that rock of known kinds extends to far greater depths.</p>

  <p><b>The interior.—</b>Concerning the great interior of the earth, little
    is known except by inference. From the weight of the earth,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it is
    inferred that its interior is much more dense than its surface. From
    its behavior under the attraction of other bodies, it is believed to
    be at least as rigid as steel, and its interior cannot, therefore,
    be liquid, in the usual sense of that term. From the phenomena of
    volcanoes, and from observations on temperature in deep borings, it is
    inferred that its interior is very hot. Further inferences concerning
    its character are less simply stated, and will be referred to later.</p>

  <p>The solid part of the earth is therefore composed of (1) a thin layer
    of unconsolidated or earthy material, a few feet to a few hundred feet
    in thickness, covering (2) a layer or zone many thousands of feet, and
    probably many miles, thick, composed of solid rock comparable to that
    exposed at numerous points on the surface, and (3) a central mass, to
    which the preceding layers are but a shell, composed of hot, dense, and
    rigid rock, the real nature of which is not known by observation.</p>

  <p><b>Varieties of rock in crust.—</b>If the mantle of soil, subsoil, and
    glacial rubbish were stripped from the land, the surface beneath would
    be found to be made up of a great variety of rocks, all of which may be
    grouped into two great classes. About four-fifths of the land surface
    would be of rock arranged in layers, and the other fifth would be of
    crystalline rock, generally without distinct stratification, and often
    bearing evidence of the effects of high temperature.</p>

  <p><b>Stratified rocks.—</b>The composition of most stratified rocks
    corresponds somewhat closely with the composition of sediments now
    being carried from the land and being deposited in the sea. Their
    arrangement in layers is the same, and the markings on the surfaces
    of the layers, such as ripple-marks, rill-marks, wave-marks, etc.,
    are identical. Furthermore, the stratified rocks of the land, like
    the recent sediments <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>of the sea, frequently contain the shells and
    skeletons of animals, and sometimes the impressions of plants. Most of
    the relics of life found in the stratified rocks belonged to animals
    or plants which lived in salt water. Because of their structure, their
    composition, their distinctive markings, and the remains of life which
    they contain, it is confidently inferred that most of the stratified
    rocks which lie beneath the mantle rock of the land were originally
    laid down in beds beneath the sea, and that the familiar processes of
    the present time furnish the key to their history.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Conformability.—</b>When the stratified rocks exposed by the removal
    of the mantle rock are examined, the successive beds are sometimes
    found to lie on one another in regular succession, showing that they
    were laid down one after another, without change in the attitude of the
    surface on which they were deposited. Such rocks are <i>conformable</i>
    (the beds of series <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig001"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1</a>). In other cases it would be
    seen that certain beds overlie the worn surfaces of lower beds, the
    layers of which may have a different angle of inclination (series
    <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig001"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1</a>, is unconformable on series <i>b</i>). Such relations
    show that the lower series of beds was disturbed and eroded before
    the overlying beds were deposited on them. Such series of rocks are
    <i>unconformable</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Relative ages.—</b>The structure and relations of rocks lead to
    inferences as to their relative ages. In the case of stratified
    rocks it is obvious that overlying beds were deposited later than
    those below, and where there is unconformity it is evident that an
    interval of time elapsed between the deposition of the unconformable
    series. Another and in some respects more important means of telling
    their order of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> formation is found in the remains of life entrapped
    in the water-laid sediments. Whatever life existed in the waters
    in which the sediments were deposited was liable to burial, and if
    it was possessed of hard parts, such as bones, teeth, shells, hard
    integuments, etc., these parts, or at least their impressions, were
    likely to be preserved in the sediments. Even tracks and imprints of
    perishable parts are sometimes preserved. All these relics, which
    we call <i>fossils</i>, give indications of the kinds of life which
    existed when the beds were formed. The fossils of the youngest beds
    show that the life which existed when they were deposited was quite
    like that of the present time. The fossils of the next older and lower
    beds show greater departure from present types. This series of changes
    continues downward as lower and lower beds are studied, until beds at
    considerable depths contain no relics of existing species but, in lieu
    thereof, forms of more primitive types. Some of these earlier types are
    clearly the ancestors of more modern forms, while others seem to have
    no living descendants. Going still deeper, the fossils indicate life of
    more and more primitive types, until they depart very widely from the
    living forms, and seem to be but remotely ancestral. So the beds may be
    followed downward until the lowest, which contain distinct evidences of
    life, are reached.</p>

  <p>It should be understood that it is not possible to proceed directly
    downward through the whole succession of bedded rocks, but that the
    edges of the various beds may be found here and there where they have
    been brought to the surface by warpings or tiltings, or exposed by
    the wearing away of the beds which once overlay them. The full series
    of strata is made out only by putting together the data gathered
    throughout all lands, and even when this is done an absolutely complete
    series cannot yet be made out or, at least, has not been.</p>

  <p><b>The crystalline rocks.—</b>The crystalline rocks which would appear
    if the mantle rock were removed are of two types, <i>igneous</i> and
    <i>metamorphic</i>. Igneous rocks may be loosely defined as hardened
    lavas. Metamorphic rocks are those which are greatly changed from their
    original condition. Either stratified or igneous rocks may become
    metamorphic.</p>

  <p>Igneous rocks sustain various relations to the stratified rocks, as
    illustrated by <a href="#fig002"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2</a>. From these relations it is possible to tell
    something of the order of their formation. Where the stratified rocks
    are broken through by lavas, it is obvious that the stratified rocks
    were formed first, and the lavas intruded later. Lava sheets intruded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
    between beds of stratified rock can be told from those which flowed out
    on the surface and were subsequently buried, for in the former case the
    sedimentary rocks, both above and below the igneous rock, were affected
    by the heat, while in the latter case only those below were so affected.</p>

  <p>More commonly than otherwise the metamorphic rocks (<a href="#fig003"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 3</a>) lie beneath
    the sedimentary beds and are often broken through by the igneous rocks.
    From their position in many places their great age may be inferred, but
    locally, especially where dynamic action has been severe, relatively
    young rocks are metamorphic.</p>

  <p><b>Four great sedimentary eras.—</b>The water-laid series represents
    four great eras in the history of the earth, as shown by the relics
    of life imbedded in them. Beginning with the latest, these are the
    <i>Cenozoic</i> (recent life), during which the life took on its modern
    aspect; the <i>Mesozoic</i> (middle life), during which the life bore
    a mediæval aspect; the <i>Paleozoic</i> (ancient life), during which
    the life belonged to older types; and the <i>Proterozoic</i> (earlier
    life), during which it is inferred that much life prevailed, though
    its record is very imperfect. It may safely be assumed to have been
    more primitive than that of the Paleozoic, as it was earlier. Each
    of these great divisions embraced several lesser periods or epochs,
    and these again are subdivided more and more closely according to the
    degrees of refinement to which studies are carried. The chief of these
    subdivisions are given in the table on <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>, and others will come
    under consideration in the historical chapters.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

  <p>In these four great series of sedimentary rocks there are, here and
    there, intrusions of igneous rocks, and in some places the sedimentary
    beds have been metamorphosed into crystalline rocks by heat and
    pressure. This is particularly true in the lowest of these series, the
    Proterozoic, where a large part of the sediment is metamorphosed, and
    where there is much igneous rock, but it is still clear that the main
    portion of this series was originally water-laid sediment, and so it
    belongs to the sedimentary series rather than the Archean, in which the
    sediments are the minor rather than the main factor. It has, however,
    usually been classed with the Archean, and it is certainly not always
    easy to draw the dividing line. In a sense it may be regarded as a
    transition series.</p>

  <p><b>The Archean complex.—</b>Beneath the dominantly sedimentary but
    partly metamorphic and igneous series there is a very complex group of
    rocks largely of metamorphosed igneous origin, though containing some
    metamorphosed sediments. These extend downwards to unknown depths.
    While all the great formations are occasionally bent and broken, these
    lowest ones are almost everywhere warped, folded, and contorted, often
    in the most intricate way. They have been very generally mashed and
    sheared by enormous pressure, so that they have become foliated, and
    their original character is much masked. They therefore form a series
    of great obscurity and complexity. As they are at the bottom of the
    known series, they have been called the “Fundamental gneiss” and the
    “Basement complex,” but as the part which we see is not the true base
    nor the true foundation, it is safer to call them simply the Archean
    (very ancient) complex. As life appears to have been present during
    a part at least of the period of its formation is referred to the
    Archeozoic era.</p>

  <p>Beyond and below this series, the structure of the earth is a matter
    of inference. Vast as are the preceding series, they together form
    relatively but a thin shell on the outer surface of the globe.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this general survey is to bring the salient features
    of the earth’s structure into view preparatory to entering in more
    detail into the study of particular processes and special formations
    and to lay a foundation for the fuller apprehension of the successive
    stages of the history of the earth, which constitutes the chief purpose
    of geological study. It is now advisable to turn to the detailed
    consideration of individual processes and specific structures. The
    complexity of the actions involved in the history of the earth is so
    great that such separate consideration at the outset is helpful.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE ATMOSPHERE AS A GEOLOGICAL AGENT.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">While</span> it is convenient to regard the lithosphere as the earth proper,
    and the atmosphere as its envelope, the latter is as truly a part of
    the planet as the former, and its activities and its history are as
    truly subjects of geological study as the formation of the rocks.
    This view is in no way vitiated by the fact that the special study
    of the atmosphere is set apart under the name <i>Meteorology</i>,
    for in the same way the special study of rocks is set apart under
    the name <i>Petrology</i>, that of ancient life under the name
    <i>Paleontology</i>, and that of other phases of the subject under
    other names. The atmosphere is one of the three great formations of
    the earth, and as a geological factor takes its place beside the
    hydrosphere and the lithosphere. It has played a part in the history
    of the earth comparable to that of the water, though its mass is less
    and its record more elusive. Unsubstantial as the atmosphere seems when
    contrasted with the liquid and solid portions of the earth, its extreme
    mobility and its chemical activity compensate for its lightness and
    tenuity, and give it a function of the first order of importance.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere plays a direct part as (1) a mechanical and (2) a
    chemical agent, and at the same time serves an indirect function
    in furnishing favorable conditions under which (3) solar radiation
    produces temperature effects, and (4) evaporation gives origin
    to precipitation and stream effects, and furnishes the necessary
    conditions for land plants and animals, and the important influences
    that spring from them.</p>

  <p>This chapter is devoted to the work of the atmosphere in these and some
    less notable phases. The consideration of the origin and history of the
    atmosphere will receive attention later.</p>

  <h3>A. THE ATMOSPHERE AS A DIRECT AGENCY.</h3>

  <h4><i>I. Mechanical Work.</i></h4>

  <p>The mechanical work of the atmosphere is accomplished chiefly through
    its movement. A feeble breeze is competent to move particles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> of dust,
    and winds of moderate velocity to shift sand. Exceptionally strong
    winds sometimes move small pebbles, but winds of sufficient force to
    move larger pieces of rock are rare. It follows, therefore, that the
    impact of the wind has little direct effect except on surfaces covered
    with dust and dry sand.</p>

  <p>The transportation of material by the wind is limited by the size
    of the particles to which it has access. Dust particles expose more
    surface to the wind relative to their mass than sand grains. Winds
    which are unable to carry sand may still carry dust, and winds which
    are able to shift sand no more than a trivial distance may blow dust
    great distances.</p>

  <p>The common conception of wind as a horizontal movement of some part
    of the atmosphere is not altogether accurate. Every obstacle against
    which wind blows causes deflections of its currents, and some of these
    deflections are upward. Furthermore, there are exceptional winds,
    in which the vertical element predominates. Particles of dust are
    often involved in these upward currents, and by them carried to great
    heights, and in the upper air are transported great distances.</p>

  <p><b>Transportation and deposition of dust.</b><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—The universality of
    the transportation of dust by the wind is well known. No house, no
    room, and scarcely a drawer can be so tightly closed but that dust
    enters it, and the movements of dust in the open must be much more
    considerable. The visible dustiness of the atmosphere in dry regions
    during wind-storms is adequate and familiar proof of the efficiency of
    the wind as a transporter of dust.</p>

  <p>Under special circumstances, opportunity is afforded for rough
    determinations of the distance and height to which wind-blown dust is
    transported. Snow taken from snow-fields in high mountain regions is
    found to contain a small amount of earthy matter. Its particles are
    often found to be in part volcanic, even when the place whence the snow
    was taken is scores or even hundreds of miles from the nearest volcano.
    There is probably no snow-field so high, or so far from volcanoes, but
    that volcanic dust reaches it. If this be true of all snow-fields,
    it is probably true of all land surfaces. In the great Krakatoa<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
    eruptions of 1883 large quantities of volcanic ash (pulverized lava)
    were projected to great heights into the atmosphere. The coarser
    particles <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>soon settled; but, caught by the currents of the upper
    atmosphere, many of the finer particles were transported incredible
    distances. Through all their long journey, the particles of dust were
    gradually settling from the atmosphere, but not until the dust had
    traveled repeatedly round the earth did its amount become so small as
    to cease to make its influence felt in the historic red sunsets which
    it occasioned.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Some of this dust completed the circuit of the earth
    in 15 days.</p>

  <p>In various parts of Kansas and Nebraska<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> there are very considerable
    beds of volcanic dust, locally as much as 30 feet thick, which must
    have been transported from volcanic vents by the wind, though there
    are no known centers of volcanic action, past or present, within some
    hundreds of miles of some of the localities where the dust occurs.
    These beds of volcanic dust, so far from its source, may serve as an
    illustration of the importance of atmospheric movements as a geological
    force.</p>

  <p>Volcanic dust is shot into the atmosphere rather than picked up by
    it. Dust picked up by the wind is perhaps transported not less widely
    than volcanic dust, but, after settling, its point of origin is less
    readily determined. It would perhaps be an exaggeration to say that
    every square mile of land surface contains particles of dust brought to
    it by the wind from every other square mile, but such a statement would
    probably involve much less exaggeration than might at first be supposed.</p>

  <p>Examples of extensive deposits of dust other than volcanic are also
    known. In China there is an extensive earthy formation, <i>the
    loess</i>, sometimes reaching 1,000 feet in thickness, which von
    Richtofen believes to have been deposited by the wind.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This
    conclusion has, however, not passed unchallenged.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The loess of some
    other regions has been referred to the same origin, and some of it is
    quite certainly eolian.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p>The transportation of dust is important wherever strong winds blow over
    dry surfaces, free or nearly free of vegetation, and composed of earthy
    matter. Its effects may be seen in such regions as the sage-brush
    plains of western North America. The roots of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>sage-brush hold the
    soil immediately about them, but between the clumps of brush, where
    there is little other vegetation, the wind has often blown away the
    soil to such an extent that each clump of brush stands up several
    inches, or even a foot or two, above its surroundings (<a href="#fig005"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 5</a>). Such
    mounds are often partly due to the lodgment of dust about the bushes.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig005">
    <img class="illowp96" src="images/fig005.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 5.—This figure shows the effect of
      sage-brush or other similar vegetation in holding sand or earth, or in
      causing its lodgment, in dry regions.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Where the earthy matter is moist, the cohesion of the particles is
    great, and the wind cannot pick them up. Furthermore, if the surface
    is generally moist, it is likely to be covered with vegetation which
    protects it against the wind. But even where vegetation is prevalent
    the wind finds many a vulnerable point. Thus on the edges of plains
    or plateaus facing abrupt valleys, the wind attacks the soil from
    the side, and in such situations all earthy matter may be stripped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
    from the underlying rock for considerable distances from the edge of
    the cliff (<a href="#fig006"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 6</a>). This may be seen at numerous points on the lava
    plateaus of Washington.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig006">
    <img class="illowp66" src="images/fig006.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 6.—Diagram to illustrate the way in
      which the wind sometimes strips the soil from the edge of a bluff.
      This phenomenon is not rare in the basin of the Columbia River in
      Washington.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The presence of dust in the upper atmosphere during a rain-storm is
    sometimes the occasion of phenomena which are often misinterpreted. If
    there be abundant dust in the atmosphere through which rain-drops or
    snowflakes fall, much of it is gathered up by them, and the water is
    thereby rendered turbid and the snow discolored. Here is to be found
    the explanation of “mud-rain,” “blood-rain” (red dust), etc.</p>

  <p>Since dust is carried to a considerable extent in the upper atmosphere,
    its movements and its deposition are little affected by obstacles on
    the surface of the land. A building or a hedge can only affect the
    lodgment of that part of the atmospheric dust which comes in contact
    with it or is swept into its lee. Since most obstacles on the surface
    of the solid part of the earth reach up but slight distances into the
    atmosphere, the dust of the greater part of the air settles without
    especial reference to them, and is spread more or less uniformly over
    the surface on which it falls.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig007">

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 7.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of an
      obstacle on the transportation and deposition of sand. The direction of
      the wind is indicated by the upper arrow. The lower arrows represent
      the direction of eddies in the air occasioned by the obstacle. If the
      surface in which the obstacle was set was originally flat (dotted
      line), the sand would tend to be piled up on either side at a little
      distance from the obstacle, but more to leeward. At the same time,
      depressions would be hollowed out near the obstacle itself (see full
      line). (After Cornish.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Much of the dust transported by the wind is carried out over seas or
    lakes and falls into them. By this means, sedimentation is doubtless
    going on at the bottom of the whole ocean, and at the bottoms of all
    lakes. While means of determining the amount of dust blown into the
    sea are not at hand, it is safe to say that, were such determinations
    possible, the result, if stated in terms of weight, would be surprising.</p>

    the wind, sand is not commonly lifted far above the surface of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    land, and its movement is therefore more generally interfered with by
    surface obstacles than is the movement of dust. A shrub, a tree, a
    fence, a building, or even a stone may occasion the lodgment of sand
    in considerable quantity, though it has little effect on the lodgment
    of dust. The effect of obstacles is illustrated by <a href="#fig007"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 7</a> (see also
    <a href="#fig005"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 5</a>). If the obstacle which occasions the lodgment of sand presents
    a surface which the wind cannot penetrate, such as a wall, sand is
    dropped abundantly on its windward side as well as on the leeward;
    but if it be penetrable, like an open fence, the lodgment takes place
    chiefly on its leeward side. In cultivated regions cases are known
    where, in a few weeks of dry weather, sand has been drifted into lanes
    in the lee of hedges to the depth of two or three feet, making them
    nearly impassable to vehicles.</p>

  <p><b>Formation of dunes.—</b>In contrast with dust deposited from the
    atmosphere, wind-blown sand is commonly aggregated into mounds and
    ridges in the process of lodgment. These mounds and ridges are dunes.
    Once a dune is started, it occasions the further lodgment of sand, and
    is a cause of its own growth. Dunes sometimes reach heights of 200 or
    300 feet, but they are much more commonly no more than 10 or 20 feet in
    height. On plane surfaces, there is a limit in height above which they
    do not rise, though the limit is different under different conditions.
    The velocity of wind at the bottom of the air is not so great as that
    higher up, and as a dune is built up, a level is presently reached
    where the stronger upper winds sweep away as much sand as is brought to
    the top. The very even crests of many dune ridges are probably to be
    accounted for in this way. Wind-blown or eolian sand, not piled up in
    heaps or ridges, is somewhat widespread, but does not constitute dunes.</p>

  <p><b>Shapes of dunes.</b><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>—Dunes may assume the form of ridges or
    of hillocks. The ridges may be transverse to the direction of the
    prevailing wind or parallel with it. Where dunes assume the form of
    hillocks rather than ridges, a group of them may be elongate in a
    direction parallel to the dominant wind, or at right angles thereto.
    The shape assumed by a dune or a group of dunes depends on the
    abundance of the sand, the strength and direction of the wind, and the
    shape of the obstacle which occasions the lodgment.</p>

  <p>The incipient stages of dune formation are readily seen in many dry,
    sandy regions. The dune is likely to start in the lee of some obstacle,
    and to be elongate in the direction of the wind, especially if the wind
    be strong relative to the supply of sand. This shape is permanently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
    preserved if the proper relations between the supply of sand and
    strength and direction of wind are preserved. In the dune region of the
    Indian desert<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the prevailing winds are alternately the southwest
    and northeast monsoons, the former being the stronger. The supply
    of sand comes from the southwest. Near the southwest coast the dune
    ridges are parallel to the direction of the wind (<a href="#fig008"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 8</a>); in the
    interior, where the winds are less strong, the dunes are transverse to
    it (<a href="#fig009"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 9</a>); while between the districts where these two types prevail
    intermediate forms occur. The transverse dune ridges (<a href="#fig009"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 9</a>) are said
    to be the result of the lateral growth and erosion of longitudinal
    dunes.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In regions of changeable winds the shape of the dunes
    is subject to great variation. Dunes are sometimes crescentic, the
    convexity facing the wind (<a href="#fig010"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 10</a>).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

  <p>Along coasts, dune ridges are often transverse to the wind, and groups
    of dune hillocks are frequently elongate in the same direction. Here
    the source of supply of the sand is itself an elongate belt, often
    transverse to the dominant wind, and the resulting dunes often have
    great length transverse to the wind. Where the wind has strong mastery
    over the sand, the longitudinal tendency is seen, even along coasts.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  </figure>

  <p>The shapes of dunes in section, like the shapes in ground-plan, depend
    on the relative strength and constancy of the winds and the supply of
    sand. With constant winds and abundant drifting sand, dunes are steep
    on the lee side (<i>bc</i>, <a href="#fig011"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 11</a>), where the angle of slope is the
    angle of rest for the sand. It rarely exceeds 23° or 24°.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Under the
    same conditions the windward slope is relatively gentle (<i>ab</i>,
    <a href="#fig011"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 11</a>). If the winds be variable so that the windward slope of one
    period becomes the leeward slope of another, and vice versa, this
    form is not preserved. Thus, by reversal of the wind, the section
    <i>abc</i>, <a href="#fig011"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 11</a>, may be changed to <i>adc</i>. If the winds and
    the supply of sand be equal, on the average, from opposite directions,
    the slopes should, on the average, be equal, though perhaps unequal
    after any particular storm. The steep slopes of new-made dunes are
    lost after the sand has ceased to be blown. At some points where the
    winds erode (scour) more than they deposit, new profiles are developed
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig012">12</a> and <a href="#fig013">13</a>). The erosion profiles may be very irregular if the
    dunes are partially covered with vegetation. The effect of vegetation
    in restraining wind erosion is shown in <a href="#fig014"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 14</a>, where plants have
    preserved a remnant of a dune.</p>

    <p><b>The topographic map.—</b>Since dunes as well as other
      topographic features are conveniently represented on contour maps,
      and since such maps will be used frequently in the following pages,
      a general explanation of them is here introduced.</p>

    <p>“The features represented on the topographic map are of three
      distinct kinds: (1) inequalities of surface, called <i>relief</i>,
      as plains, plateaus, valleys, hills, and mountains; (2)
      distribution of water, called <i>drainage</i>, as streams, lakes,
      and swamps; (3) the works of man, called <i>culture</i>, as roads,
      railroads, boundaries, villages, and cities.</p>

    <p><b>Relief.—</b>All elevations are measured from mean sea-level.
      The heights of many points are accurately determined, and those
      which are most important are given on the map in figures. It is
      desirable, however, to give the elevation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> of all parts of the
      area mapped, to delineate the horizontal outline, or contour, of
      all slopes, and to indicate their grade or degree of steepness.
      This is done by lines connecting points of equal elevation
      above mean sea-level, the lines being drawn at regular vertical
      intervals. These lines are called <i>contours</i>, and the uniform
      vertical space between each two contours is called the <i>contour
      interval</i>. On the maps of the United States Geological Survey
      the contours and elevations are printed in brown (see <a href="#plate_II">Plate II</a>).</p>

    <figure class="figcenter" id="fig015">

      <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 15.—Sketch and map of the same area
        to illustrate the representation of topography by means of contour
        lines (<abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The manner in which contours express elevation, form, and grade is
      shown in the following sketch and corresponding contour map, <a href="#fig015"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
      15</a>.</p>

    <p>The sketch represents a river valley between two hills. In the
      foreground is the sea, with a bay which is partly closed by a
      hooked sand bar. On each side of the valley is a terrace. From
      the terrace on the right a hill rises gradually, while from that
      on the left the ground ascends steeply in a precipice. Contrasted
      with this precipice is the gentle descent of the slope at the left.
      In the map each of these features is indicated, directly beneath
      its position in the sketch, by contours. The following explanation
      may make clearer the manner in which contours delineate elevation,
      form, and grade:</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

    <p>1. A contour indicates approximately a certain height above
      sea-level. In this illustration the contour interval is 50 feet;
      therefore the contours are drawn at 50, 100, 150, 200 feet, and
      so on, above sea-level. Along the contour at 250 feet lie all
      points of the surface 250 feet above sea; and similarly with any
      other contour. In the space between any two contours are found
      all elevations above the lower and below the higher contour. Thus
      the contour at 150 feet falls just below the edge of the terrace,
      while that at 200 feet lies above the terrace; therefore all points
      on the terrace are shown to be more than 150 but less than 200
      feet above sea. The summit of the higher hill is stated to be 670
      feet above sea; accordingly the contour at 650 feet surrounds it.
      In this illustration nearly all the contours are numbered. Where
      this is not possible, certain contours—say every fifth one—are
      accentuated and numbered; the heights of others may then be
      ascertained by counting up or down from a numbered contour.</p>

    <p>2. Contours define the forms of slopes. Since contours are
      continuous horizontal lines conforming to the surface of the
      ground, they wind smoothly about smooth surfaces, recede into
      all reëntrant angles of ravines, and project in passing about
      prominences. The relations of contour curves and angles to forms of
      the landscape can be traced in the map and sketch.</p>

    <p>3. Contours show the approximate grade of any slope. The vertical
      space between two contours is the same, whether they lie along a
      cliff or on a gentle slope; but to rise a given height on a gentle
      slope one must go farther than on a steep slope, and therefore
      contours are far apart on gentle slopes and near together on steep
      ones.</p>

    <p>For a flat or gently undulating country a small contour interval
      is used; for a steep or mountainous country a large interval is
      necessary. The smallest interval used on the atlas sheets of the
      Geological Survey is 5 feet. This is used for regions like the
      Mississippi delta and the Dismal Swamp. In mapping great mountain
      masses, like those in Colorado, the interval may be 250 feet. For
      intermediate relief contour intervals of 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100
      feet are used.</p>

    <p><b>Drainage.—</b>Watercourses are indicated by blue lines. If the
      streams flow the year round the line is drawn unbroken, but if the
      channel is dry a part of the year the line is broken or dotted.
      Where a stream sinks and reappears at the surface, the supposed
      underground course is shown by a broken blue line. Lakes, marshes,
      and other bodies of water are also shown in blue, by appropriate
      conventional signs.</p>

    <p><b>Culture.—</b>The works of man, such as road, railroads, and
      towns, together with boundaries of townships, counties and states,
      and artificial details, are printed in black.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>Topography of dune areas.—</b>From what has been said, it is clear
    that the topography of dune regions may vary widely, but it is always
    distinctive. Where the dunes take the form of ridges (<a href="#plate02a"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr>
    II</a>), the ridges are often of essentially uniform height and width for
    considerable distances. If there are parallel ridges, they are often
    separated <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>by trough-like depressions. Where dunes assume the form of
    hillocks (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#plate02b">2</a> and <a href="#plate02c">3</a>, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> II), rather than ridges, the topography
    is even more distinctive. In some regions, depressions (basins) are
    associated with the dune hillocks. Occasionally they are hardly less
    notable than the dunes themselves. A somewhat similar association of
    hillocks and basins is locally developed by other means, but dunes are
    made up of sand and usually of sand only, while the composition of
    similarly shaped hillocks and depressions shaped by other agencies is
    notably different.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In <a href="#plate02a"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, Plate II</a> (Five Mile Beach, 8 miles northeast of Cape
      May, <abbr title="New Jersey">N.&nbsp;J.</abbr>), the contour interval is 10 feet. There is here but one
      contour line (the 10-foot contour), though this appears in several
      places. Since this line connects places 10 feet above sea-level,
      all places between it and the sea (or marsh) are less than 10
      feet above the water, while all places within the lines have an
      elevation of more than 10 feet. None of them reaches an elevation
      of 20 feet, since a 20-foot contour does not appear. It will be
      seen that some of the elevations in <a href="#plate02a"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1</a> are elongate, while
      others have the form of mounds.</p>

    <p><a href="#plate02b"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2</a> (<a href="#plate_II"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> II</a>) shows dune topography along the Arkansas River in
      Kansas (near Larned); <a href="#plate02d"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 4</a>, dune topography in Nebraska (<abbr title="Latitude">Lat.</abbr>

      shore; and <a href="#plate02c"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 3</a> shows irregular ridge-like dunes at the head of
      Lake Michigan. In <a href="#plate02b"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2</a> the contour interval is 20 feet. All the
      small hillocks southeast of the river are dunes. Some of them are
      represented by one contour and some by two. The altitude of the
      region is considerable, the heavy contour representing an elevation
      of 2100 feet; but the dunes themselves are rarely more than 20 feet
      above their surroundings. In <a href="#plate02d"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 4</a>, where the contour interval is
      also 20 feet, there are, besides the numerous hillocks, several
      depressions (basins). These are represented by hachures inside the
      contour lines. In some cases there are intermittent lakes (blue) in
      the depressions. The heavy contour at Spring Lakes in this figure
      is the contour of 4300 feet. There are two depression contours
      (4280 and 4260) below it. The bottom of the depression is therefore
      lower than 4260, but not so low as 4240. In <a href="#plate02c"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 3</a> the contour
      interval is 10 feet, and the dune ridges north of Miller are more
      than 50 feet high. The dune ridges here have helped to determine
      the position of this branch of the Calumet River, and have blocked
      its former outlet. The present drainage is to the westward.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><b>Migration of dunes.—</b>By the continual transfer of sand from its
    windward to its leeward side, a dune may be moved from one place to
    another, though continuing to be made up, in large part, of the same
    sand. In their migration dunes sometimes invade fertile lands, causing
    so great loss that means are devised for stopping them. The simplest
    method (employed in France and Holland) is to help vegetation to get
    a foothold in the sand. The effect of the vegetation is to pin the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
    sand down. As a dune ridge along a coast travels inland, another may be
    formed behind it. Successions of dune ridges are thus sometimes formed.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>A remarkable instance of the migration of a sand dune is recorded
    on the Kurische Nehrung on the north coast of Germany. The Nehrung
    consists of a long narrow neck of land composed of sand, lying
    off the main coast. At the beginning of this century there was a
    notable dune ridge on one side. Since that time it has migrated a
    considerable distance, and in its migration it has been brought into
    the relationships illustrated in the accompanying diagrams (<a href="#fig016"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 16</a>).
    In 1800<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> the dune ridge was on one side of a church, which was then in
    use. In 1839 the ridge had been so far shifted to the leeward as to
    completely bury the church, and in 1869, its migration had progressed
    so far as to again discover the building.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

    (<a href="#fig017"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 17</a>). In one instance on the coast of Prussia a tall pine forest,

    tops of the highest trees are exposed. Trees and other objects once

  <p>Eolian sand, not aggregated into distinct dunes, is often destructive.
    Even valleys and cities are sometimes buried by it. Drifting sands had
    so completely buried Nineveh two centuries after its destruction that
    its site was unknown.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution of dunes.—</b>Dunes are likely to be developed wherever
    dry sand is exposed to the wind. Their favorite situations are the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>dry and sandy shores of lakes and seas, sandy valleys, and arid sandy
    plains.</p>

  <p>Along coasts, dunes are likely to be extensively developed only where
    the prevailing winds are on shore. Thus about Lake Michigan, where the
    prevailing winds are from the west, dunes are abundant and large on the
    east shore, and but few and small on the west. In shallow water, shore
    currents and storm waves often build up a reef of sand a little above
    the normal level of the water. When the waves subside, the sand dries
    and the wind heaps it up into dunes. This sequence of events is in
    progress at many points on the Atlantic Coast. Sandy Hook, New Jersey,
    and the “beaches” farther south started as barrier ridges. When the
    waves had built them above normal water-level, the wind re-worked the
    sand, piling it up into mounds and hillocks (<a href="#plate02a"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> II</a>). Such dune
    belts a little off shore are sometimes turned to good account. They are
    usually separated from the mainland by a shallow lagoon. Where land
    is valuable, the lagoon is sometimes filled in, making new land, thus
    anticipating the result which nature would achieve more slowly. This
    has been done at some points on the western coast of Europe.</p>

    their bottoms or slopes are of sand, and not covered by vegetation.
    Dunes along valleys are usually on the side toward which the
    prevailing winds blow. Thus they are more common on the east side of
    the Mississippi than on the west. Dunes may be formed in the valley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    bottoms, but the sand is often blown up out of the valley and lodged on
    the bluffs above.</p>

  <p>Apart from these special classes of situations, any sandy region the
    surface of which is dry is likely to have its surface material shifted
    by the wind and piled up into dune ridges or hillocks (<a href="#plate02d"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 4, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr>
    II</a>). Dunes probably reach their greatest development in the Sahara,
    where some of them take the form of hillocks, and some the form of
    ridges. Travelers in that region report that dune ridges are sometimes
    encountered the faces of which are so high and steep as to be difficult
    of ascent, and that parties have been obliged to travel miles along
    their bases before finding a break where crossing was practicable.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Wind-ripples.—</b>The surface of the dry sand over which the wind
    has blown for a few hours is likely to be marked with ripples (<a href="#fig020"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    20</a>) similar to those made on a sandy bottom beneath shallow water,
    under the influence of waves. Like ripple marks made by the water,
    wind-ripples have one side (the lee) steeper than the other. While the
    ripples are, as a rule, but a fraction of an inch high, they throw
    much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> light on the origin of the great dune ridges. If the ripples
    be watched closely during the progress of a wind-storm, they are
    found gradually to shift their position. Sand is blown up the gentler
    windward slope to the crest of the ridge and falls down on the other
    side. The moment it falls below the crest of the ridge to leeward, it
    is protected against the wind, and is likely to lodge. Wear on the
    windward side is about equal to deposition on the leeward, and the
    result is the orderly progression of the ripples in the direction in
    which the wind is blowing, just as in the case of dune ridges.</p>

  <p><b>Abrasion by the wind.—</b>While the effect of the wind on sandy
    and dusty surfaces may be considerable, its effect on solid rock is
    relatively slight and accomplished, not by its own impact, but by that
    of the material it carries. The effect of blown sand on rock surfaces
    over and against which it is driven is perhaps best understood by
    recalling the effects of artificial sand-blasts, by means of which
    glass is etched. In a region where sand is blowing, exposed surfaces
    of rock suffer from a multitude of blows struck by the sand grains in
    transit. The result is that such rock surfaces are worn, and worn in a
    way peculiar to the agency accomplishing the work. If the rock be made
    up of laminæ which are of unequal hardness, the blown sand digs out
    the softer ones, leaving the harder projecting as ridges between them.
    Adjacent masses of harder and softer rock of whatever thickness are
    similarly affected. The sculpturing thus effected on projecting masses
    of rock is often picturesque and striking (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig021">21</a> and <a href="#fig022">22</a>), and is
    most common in arid regions. Details of wind-carving are shown in <a href="#fig023"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>

  <p>Sand drifted over loose stones lying on the surface often develops
    flat or flattish faces or facets on them. These facets are likely to
    be three in number, and the exposed portion of the stone is likely to
    develop a sort of pyramidal shape, the three flattish surfaces being
    mutually limited by tolerably well-defined lines (<a href="#fig024"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 24</a>). Thus arise
    the three-faceted stones (<i>Dreikanter</i> of the Germans) commonly
    seen where sands have been long in movement.</p>

      sandstone. Missouri River, Montana. (Calhoun, <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;S.</abbr>)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Not only does the drifting sand wear the surface over which it passes
    and against which it strikes, but the grains themselves are worn in the
    process. They are liable to be broken as they strike rock surfaces, and
    they are likely to strike one another in the atmosphere. In both cases
    they are subject to wear, and so to reduction to a finer and finer
    state.</p>

  <p>The erosion accomplished by the wind is therefore of various sorts. The
    impact of the wind itself picks up the fine materials which are already
    loosened, thus wearing down the surface from which they are removed;
    the materials picked up wear the rock surfaces against which they are
    blown, and the transported materials themselves suffer reduction in
    transit.</p>

  <p><b>Effects of wind on plants.—</b>Another effect of wind work is
    seen in the uprooting of trees (<a href="#fig025"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 25</a>). The uprooting disturbs the
    surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> in such a way as to make loose earth more readily accessible
    to wind and water. The uprooting of trees on steep slopes often causes
    the descent of considerable quantities of loose rock and soil. Again,
    organisms of various sorts (certain types of seeds, germs, etc.), as
    well as dust and sand, are extensively transported by the wind. While
    this is important biologically its geological effects are remote.</p>

  <p><b>Indirect effects of the wind.—</b>Other dynamic processes are called
    into being or stimulated by the atmosphere. Winds generate both waves
    and currents, and both are effective agents in geological work. The
    results of their activities are discussed elsewhere.</p>

  <h4><i>II. The Chemical Work of the Atmosphere.</i></h4>

  <p>The chemical work of the atmosphere (including solution and
    precipitation from solution) is principally accomplished in connection
    with water, a dry atmosphere having relatively little direct chemical
    effect on rock or soils.</p>

  <p><b>Precipitation from solution.—</b>The water in the soil is constantly
    evaporating. Such substances as it contains in solution are deposited
    where the water evaporates, and where evaporation is long continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
    without re-solution of the substances deposited, the surface becomes
    coated with an efflorescence of mineral matter. Conspicuous examples
    are found in the alkali plains of certain areas in the western part of
    the United States. Since the alkaline efflorescence is the result of
    evaporation it is connected with the atmosphere, but the material of
    the efflorescence was brought to its present position by water. The
    principle involved is illustrated by the white efflorescence which
    frequently appears on brick walls during the dry days which follow a
    drenching rain. The water penetrates the brick and mortar and dissolves
    something of their substance, and when it is evaporated from the
    surface the material in solution is left behind.</p>

  <p>In arid regions the deposition of substances other than alkali is
    common. The percolating waters dissolve whatever is soluble, and when
    they evaporate their mineral content is left. The pebbles and stones of
    the arid plains have in many places become heavily coated with mineral
    matter deposited in this way, and not infrequently cemented into
    conglomerate. One of the commonest mineral substances found in such
    situations is lime carbonate. In some cases it was doubtless derived
    by solution from limestone beds beneath the surface, but this is not
    always the case. It often encrusts the bits of lava on lava plains
    where it can hardly have been derived from limestone. The faces of
    cliffs of granite or gneiss, hundreds and even thousands of feet above
    all other sorts of rock,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> are sometimes spotted with patches of lime
    carbonate. In the first case the lime carbonate was derived by chemical
    change from the lava, and in the second, from the granite or gneiss
    (see <a href="#Carbonation"><i>Carbonation</i></a> below), but its present position is the result
    of evaporation.</p>

  <p><b>Oxidation.—</b>In the presence of moisture the oxygen of the air
    enters into combination with various elements of the soil and rocks.
    This is <i>oxidation</i>. No other common mineral substance shows the
    results of oxidation so quickly and so distinctly as iron. The oxidized
    portion is loose and friable, and a mass of iron exposed to a moist
    atmosphere will ultimately crumble away. This change is comparable to
    other less obvious changes taking place in many minerals at and below
    the surface. Oxidation generally involves the disintegration of the
    rock concerned. Its effects in this direction will be referred to in
    other connections.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

  <p id="Carbonation"><b>Carbonation.—</b>The production of lime carbonate from rock
    containing calcium compounds, but not in the form of carbonates, is
    known as <i>carbonation</i>, and is one of the important chemical
    changes effected by the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere in coöperation
    with water. In the process of carbonation the original minerals of
    complex composition are decomposed and simpler ones usually formed.
    Volumetric changes are involved, which often lead to the disruption of
    the rock (see <i>Ground water</i>). Furthermore, carbonates are among
    the more soluble minerals, and their production therefore brings some
    of the rock materials into a soluble condition, and their extraction
    through solution tends still further to disintegrate the rock. The
    carbonation of crystalline rocks is therefore a disintegrating process,
    and will be considered further in its many concrete applications.</p>

  <p><b>Other chemical changes.—</b>A third chemical process which often
    accompanies oxidation and carbonation is <i>hydration</i>. This is
    effected by water rather than by air, and will be considered in
    that connection. In general it leads to the disintegration of the
    minerals and rocks affected. The chemical effects of nitric acid,
    etc., developed through the agency of atmospheric electricity, and
    the corresponding effects of the gases and vapors which issue from
    volcanoes, many of them chemically active, are to be mentioned in this
    connection.</p>

  <p><b>Conditions favorable for chemical changes.—</b>Conditions are not
    everywhere equally favorable for the chemical work of the atmosphere.
    In general, high temperatures facilitate chemical action, and, other
    things being equal, rocks are more readily decomposed by atmospheric
    action in warm than in cold regions. Chemical activity is probably
    greater where the climate is continuously warm than where there are
    great changes of temperature. Changes of temperature, on the other
    hand, tend to disrupt rock, and thus increase the amount of surface
    exposed to chemical change. Since nearly all the chemical changes
    worked by the atmosphere on the rocks are increased by the presence of
    moisture, the chemical activity of the atmosphere is greater in moist
    than in dry regions.</p>

  <h3>B. THE ATMOSPHERE AS A CONDITIONING AGENCY.</h3>

  <p>The most obvious mechanical work of the atmosphere is effected by the
    wind, but mechanical results of great importance, conditioned by the
    atmosphere, are also effected when the air is still.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

  <h4><i>I. Temperature Effects.</i></h4>

  <p>When the sun shines on bare rock its surface is heated and expanded,
    and the expanded particles crowd one another with great force. Since
    rock is a poor conductor of heat its surface is heated and expanded
    notably more than parts beneath the surface. It follows that strains
    are set up between the expanded outer portion and the cooler and less
    expanded parts within. In the cooling of the same rock mass it is the
    outermost portion which cools first and fastest, and, contracting as
    it cools, strains are again set up between the outer part, which is
    cooled more, and the inner part, which is cooled less. The result may
    be illustrated by the effect of cold water on hot glass, or of hot
    water on cold glass. In either case the fracture is the result of the
    sudden and considerable differential expansion or contraction. Since
    the heating and cooling of rock are much slower than the heating and
    cooling of glass under the conditions mentioned, the rupturing effects
    are less conspicuous, but none the less real. The actual effects
    of temperature changes are illustrated by familiar phenomena. The
    surface portions of bowlders exposed to the sun are frequently seen
    to be shelling off (<a href="#fig026"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 26</a>). The loosened concentric shells may be a
    fraction of an inch, or sometimes even several inches in thickness.
    This process of <i>exfoliation</i> affects not only bowlders, but bare
    rock surfaces wherever exposed to the sun (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig027">27</a>, <a href="#fig028">28</a>). It is often
    conspicuous on the faces of cliffs.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Several conditions, some of which are connected with the atmosphere and
    some with the rock, determine the efficiency of this process. Since
    the breaking of the rock results from the expansion and contraction
    due to its changes of temperature, it follows that, other things
    being equal, the greater the change, the greater the breaking; but
    the suddenness of the temperature change is even more important than
    its amount. It follows that great daily, rather than great annual,
    changes of temperature<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> favor rock-breaking, though with changes
    of a given frequency their effectiveness is greater the greater their
    range. A partial exception to this generalization should be noted.
    If abundant moisture is present in the pores and cracks of the rock
    a change of temperature from 45° to 35° (<abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>) might be far less
    effective in breaking the rock than a change from 35° to 25° in the
    same time, for in the latter case the sudden and very considerable
    expansion (about one-tenth) which water undergoes on freezing is
    brought into play. This may be called the <i>wedge-work of ice</i>.
    The daily range of temperature is influenced especially by latitude,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>altitude, and humidity. Other things being equal, the greatest daily
    ranges of temperature occur in high-temperate latitudes, though to
    this general statement there are local exceptions, depending on other
    conditions. High altitudes favor great daily ranges of temperature, so
    far as the rock surface is concerned (see <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig029">29</a>, <a href="#fig030">30</a>), for though
    the rock becomes heated during the sunny day, the thinness and dryness
    of the atmosphere allow its heat to radiate rapidly at night. Here,
    too, the daily range of temperature is likely to bring the wedge-work
    of ice into play. Since the south side of a mountain (in the northern
    hemisphere) is heated more than the north, it is subject to the greater
    daily range of temperature, and the rock on this side suffers the
    greater disruption. Similarly, rock surfaces on which the sun shines
    daily are subject to greater disruption than those much shielded by
    clouds. Isolated peaks, because of their greater exposure, are subject
    to rather greater daily ranges of temperature than plateaus of the same
    elevation.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig028">
    <img class="illowp90" src="images/fig028.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 28.—Exfoliation on a mountain slope. Mt.
      Starr-King (<abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>) from the north.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The daily range of temperature is also influenced by humidity. Because
    of the effect of water vapor in the atmosphere on insolation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> and
    radiation, a rock surface becomes hotter in the day and cooler at night
    beneath a dry atmosphere than beneath a moist one. Aridity therefore
    favors the disruption of rock by changing temperatures.</p>

  <p>Turning from the conditions of the atmosphere which affect the
    disruption of rock to the conditions of the rock which influence the
    same process, several points are to be noted. In the first place, the
    disrupting effects of changes of temperature are slight or nil where
    the solid rock is protected by soil, clay, sand, gravel, snow, or other
    incoherent material. If the constituent parts of the loose material are
    coarse, like bowlders, their surfaces are affected like those of larger
    bodies of rock. The color of rock, its texture and its composition,
    also influence its range of daily temperature by influencing absorption
    and conduction. Dark-colored rocks absorb more heat than light-colored
    ones, and compact rocks are better conductors than porous ones. Great
    absorption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> and slow conduction favor disruption. A given range of
    temperature is unequally effective on rocks of different mineral
    composition. In general crystalline rocks (igneous and metamorphic) are
    more subject to disruption by this means than sedimentary rocks, partly
    because they are more compact, but especially because they are made up
    of aggregates of crystals of different minerals which, under changes of
    temperature, expand and contract at different rates, while the common
    sedimentary rocks are made up largely of numerous particles of one
    mineral.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The freezing of water in the pores of rock is effective in disrupting
    them only when the pores are essentially full at the time of freezing.
    Otherwise there is room for the expansion attending the freezing. If
    the pores of the rock are large, the expansion on freezing may force
    out sufficient water to balance the increase of volume, even though the
    rock was completely saturated. If the pores be very small the water
    passes out less readily, and if the rock is saturated, freezing is more
    likely to be attended with disruption.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

  <p>In view of these considerations the breaking of rock by changes
    of temperature should be greatest on the bare slopes of isolated
    elevations of crystalline rock, where the temperature conditions of
    temperate latitudes prevail, and where the atmosphere is relatively
    free from moisture. All these conditions are not often found in one
    place, but the disrupting effects of changing temperatures are best
    seen where several of them are associated (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig029">29</a>, <a href="#fig030">30</a>, and <a href="#fig031">31</a>).</p>

  <p>The importance of this method of rock-breaking has rarely been
    appreciated except by those who have worked in high and dry regions.
    Climbers of high mountains know that almost every high peak is covered
    with broken rock to such an extent as to make its ascent dangerous to
    the uninitiated. High serrate peaks, especially of crystalline rock,
    are, as a rule, literally crumbling to pieces (<a href="#fig031"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 31</a>). The piles
    of talus which lie at the bases of steep mountain slopes are often
    hundreds of feet in height, and their materials are often in large part
    the result of the process here under discussion. In mountain regions
    where atmospheric conditions favor sudden changes of temperature, the
    sharp reports of the disruption of rock masses are often heard. Masses
    of rock, scores and even hundreds of pounds in weight, are frequently
    thus detached and started on their downward course.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Small pieces
    of rock are of course much more commonly broken off than large ones.
    The disruption of rock by changes of temperature is not usually the
    result of a single change of temperature, but rather of many successive
    expansions and contractions.</p>

  <p>The sharp needle-like peaks which mark the summits of most high
    mountain ranges (<a href="#fig032"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 32</a>) are largely developed by the process here
    outlined. The altitude at which the serrate topography appears varies
    with the latitude, being, as a rule, higher in low latitudes and lower
    in high. But even in the same latitude it varies notably with the
    isolation of the mountains and with the aridity of the climate. Thus
    within the United States the sharply serrate summits appear in some
    places, as in Washington and Oregon, at altitudes of 6000 to 10,000
    feet, while in the isolated Wichita range of Oklahoma, much farther
    south, but in a much drier climate, the same sort of topography is
    developed at altitudes of 2500 to 3000 feet.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

  <p>Even in low latitudes and moist climates the effects of temperature
    changes are often seen. Thin beds of limestone at the bottom of
    quarries are sometimes so expanded by the heat of the sun as to arch up
    and break.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In desert and arid regions,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> whatever the altitude,
    the effects of temperature changes are often striking.</p>

  <p>The disruption of rock by changes of temperature is one phase of
    weathering. It tends to the formation of a mantle of rock waste, which,
    were it not removed, would soon completely cover the solid rock beneath
    and protect it from further disruption by heating and cooling; but the
    loose material thus produced becomes an easy prey to running water,
    so that the work of the atmosphere prepares the way for that of other
    eroding agencies.</p>

  <h4><i>II. Evaporation and Precipitation.</i></h4>

  <p>Perhaps the most important work of the atmosphere as a dynamic
    agent lies in its function as the medium for the circulation and
    distribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> of water. Atmospheric temperature is the primary
    factor governing evaporation, an important factor in the circulation
    of the vapor after it is formed, and controls its condensation and
    precipitation.</p>

  <p>The average amount of annual precipitation on the land is variously
    estimated at from forty to sixty inches, the lesser figure being
    probably more nearly correct. Since much of this water falls at high
    altitudes, the work which it accomplishes in getting back to the sea
    is great. The water which falls on the land, if withdrawn wholly from
    the ocean, would exhaust that body of water in 10,000 to 15,000 years
    if none of it returned. The work of evaporation is of course not done
    by the atmosphere, though the atmosphere determines the effect of the
    solar energy which does the work.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

  <p>The precipitation is distributed with great inequality, and this
    inequality affects both the rain and the snow. Some regions have heavy
    precipitation and some light; some regions have much rain and little
    snow; others have much snow and little rain; others have rain and no
    snow, and still others have snow and little or no rain. The amount and
    distribution of rain and snow determine the size and distribution of
    streams and glaciers, and streams and glaciers are the most important
    agencies modifying the surface of the land.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to separate sharply the geologic work of the water of
    the atmosphere from that of other waters; but so long as moisture is in
    the atmosphere (including the time of its precipitation) its effects
    are best considered in connection with the atmosphere.</p>

  <p><b>The mechanical work of the rain.—</b>In falling the rain washes the
    atmosphere, taking from it much of the dust, spores, etc., which the
    winds have lifted from the surface of the dry land. Not only this,
    but in passing through the atmosphere the water dissolves some of its
    gases, and perhaps particles of soluble solid matter. When therefore
    the falling water reaches the surface of the land it is no longer pure,
    and some of the gases it has taken up in its descent enable it to
    dissolve various mineral matters on which pure water has little effect.</p>

  <p>As it falls on the surface of the land the rain produces various
    effects of a mechanical nature. In the first place, it leaves on the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>surface the solid matter taken from the air. The amount of material,
    thus added to any given region in any particular shower is trivial,
    but in the course of long periods of time the total amount of material
    washed out of the air must be very great.</p>

  <p>Every rain-drop strikes a blow. If the drops fall on vegetation,
    they have little effect, but if they fall on sand or unprotected
    earthy matter they cause movements of the particles on one another,
    and this movement involves friction and wear. While the results thus
    effected are inconsiderable in any brief period of time, they are not
    so insignificant when the long periods of the earth’s history are
    considered.</p>

  <p>Clayey soils contract and often crack on drying. Falling on such a soil
    when it is dry the rain causes it to expand, and the cracks are healed
    by lateral swelling. The same soils are baked under the influence of
    the sun, and when in this condition are softened and made more mobile
    by the falling of rain. Under the influence of the expansion and
    contraction occasioned by wetting and drying, the soils and earths on
    slopes creep slowly downward. When rain falls on dry sand or dust the
    cohesion is at once increased, and shifting by the wind is temporarily
    stopped.</p>

  <p>After the water has fallen on the land its further work cannot be
    looked upon as a part of the work of the atmosphere; but any conception
    of the geological work of the atmosphere which did not recognize the
    fact that the waters of the land have come through the atmosphere would
    be inadequate. The work of the water after it has been precipitated
    from the atmosphere must be considered in another chapter.</p>

  <h4><i>III. Effects of Electricity.</i></h4>

  <p>Another dynamic effect conditioned by the atmosphere is that produced
    by lightning. In the aggregate this result is inconsequential; yet
    instances are known where large bodies of rock have been fractured by
    a stroke of lightning, and masses many tons in weight have sometimes
    been moved appreciable distances. Incipient fusion in very limited
    spots is also known to have been induced by lightning. Where it strikes
    sand it often fuses the sand for a short distance, and, on cooling,
    the partially fused material is consolidated, forming a little tube
    or irregular rod (a <i>fulgurite</i>) of partially glassy matter.
    Fulgurites are usually only a few inches in length, and more commonly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>than otherwise a fraction of an inch in diameter. Strictly speaking
    these results are the effect of the electricity of the atmosphere
    rather than of the atmosphere itself, but they are best mentioned in
    this connection.</p>

  <p>Allusion has already been made to the chemical changes in the
    atmosphere occasioned by electric discharges.</p>

  <h3>SUMMARY.</h3>

  <p><b>Weathering.—</b>The result of all atmospheric processes, whether
    physical or chemical, by which surface rock is disrupted, decomposed or
    in any way loosened, is <i>weathering</i>. This convenient term also
    includes similar results effected by ground water, plants, etc. The
    tendency of weathering is to produce a mantle of residuary earth over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
    solid rock. Weathering by mechanical means tends to produce material
    which, though in a finer state of division, is still like the original
    rock in chemical composition. Weathering by chemical means tends to
    produce a mantle made up chiefly of the less soluble parts of the rock
    from which it was derived. All processes of weathering prepare material
    for transportation by wind and water.</p>

  <p>Many considerations determine the thickness which the mantle of
    weathered rock (mantle rock) attains. Some of these considerations have
    to do with the atmosphere, and some with drainage. Since the latter
    are, on the whole, more important, this matter will be discussed in
    connection with the work of water (Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">IV</a>).</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE WORK OF RUNNING WATER.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Familiar</span> phenomena, both of land and sea, reveal the constant activity
    and importance of water as a geologic agent. Even when there is no
    precipitation the moisture in the air influences its activity in
    certain ways. Just as iron “rusts” more readily in moist air than
    in dry, so changes in other mineral substances are influenced by
    atmospheric humidity. Where precipitation takes place the results are
    more obvious. The passing shower works changes in the surface of the
    land, striking in proportion to the rate and amount of precipitation.
    The rains feed the streams, and every stream is modifying its bed, and
    with increasing rapidity as its current is swollen. Even the moisture
    which is precipitated as snow works its appropriate results. Before it
    melts it protects the surface against other agents of change; but if
    it accumulates in sufficient quantity in appropriate situations, it
    may give rise to avalanches and glaciers, which, like running water,
    degrade the surface over which they pass.</p>

  <p>A part of the water which falls as rain, and a part of that which
    results from the melting of snow and ice, sinks into the soil and
    into the rock below, becoming <i>ground water</i>. It is this ground
    water which especially justifies the name <i>hydrosphere</i>, often
    applied to the waters of the earth, for it literally forms a spherical
    layer in the outer portion of the solid part of the earth. During the
    stay of the water beneath the surface it effects changes in the rocks
    through which it passes, dissolving mineral matter here and depositing
    it there, substituting one substance for another in this place, and
    effecting new chemical combinations in that. Slow as these processes
    are, they have worked wondrous changes in the course of the earth’s
    history.</p>

  <p>When the waters are gathered together in ponds, lakes, and oceans, they
    are still active, and the results of their activity are seen along the
    shores, where winds and waves produce their chiefest effects. Even the
    ocean currents, far from land, and the processes of the deep sea, are
    not without their effect on the course of geological history.</p>

  <p>The work of the <i>surface waters</i>, <i>ground</i>
    (<i>underground</i>) <i>waters</i>, <i>standing waters</i>, and
    <i>ice</i> will be considered in order.</p>

  <h3>RAIN AND RIVER EROSION.</h3>

  <p>Rain and river erosion began when the first rains fell on land
    surfaces. Neither the location nor the nature of the first land surface
    is known. There is little reason to believe that the ocean was ever
    universal, but there is reason to believe that most land areas have at
    some time or other been covered by the sea. The prevalent conception
    that land areas which were once submerged came into existence by being
    elevated above sea-level, should be supplemented by the alternative
    conception that submerged areas may have become land by the depression
    of the ocean basins, thus drawing off the water from the areas
    where it was shallow. Thus in <a href="#fig036"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 36</a> the sinking of the sea-bottom
    from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> would lower the surface of the water from
    <i>cc′</i>, to <i>dd′</i>, and draw off the water from the surfaces
    <i>cd</i> and <i>c′d′</i>.</p>

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 36.—Diagram to illustrate the origin
      of lands by the lowering of the sea-level due to depression of the
      sea bottom. If the bottom is depressed from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> the
      surface will be drawn down from <i>cc′</i> to <i>dd′</i>, and the
      surfaces <i>cd</i> and <i>c′d′</i> will become land.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Without attempting to picture the character of the original land our
    study of subaërial erosion may begin with an area which has just been
    changed from sea bottom to land. What is the nature of such a land
    surface? Of what material is it composed, and what is the character of
    its topography? Concerning its constitution something may be inferred
    from the nature of the deposits now found at the bottom of the sea.
    Near the shore and in shallow water they often consist of gravel and
    sand, though other materials are not wanting. Far from shore and in
    deep water they consist for the most part of fine sediments, some of
    which were washed or blown from the land, some of which came from the
    shells and other secretions of marine animals, some from volcanoes, and
    some from various other sources. The topography of the newly emerged
    land may have had some likeness to the topography of the sea bottom.
    The numerous soundings which have been made over large areas of the
    sea have shown that its bottom is, as a rule, free from the numerous
    small irregularities which affect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> the surface of the land. They seem
    to show that a large part of the ocean bottom is so nearly flat that,
    if the water were removed, the eye would hardly detect irregularities
    in the surface. This statement does not lose sight of the fact that
    the ocean bottom is, in certain places, markedly irregular. Volcanic
    peaks and striking irregularities of other sorts abound in some places.
    Nevertheless if the bottom of the sea could be seen as the land is, its
    most striking feature, taken as a whole, would be its apparent flatness.</p>

  <p>With the topography of the sea bottom the topography of the land is,
    in its details, in sharp contrast. In order to get at the history of
    the latter, we may study the sequence of events which would follow the
    emergence of a portion of the former.</p>

  <h4><i>Subaërial Erosion without Valleys.</i></h4>

  <p>For the sake of emphasizing the fundamental principles involved in
    the work of running water, a hypothetical case will first be studied
    in some detail, even at the risk of elaborating processes already
    understood. The principles themselves will find application later in
    relations which are much less simple.</p>

  <p>Let it be assumed that the area of newly emerged land is a circular
    dome-shaped island. The simplest possible condition is represented by
    assuming its slope to be the same in all directions from the center,
    and its materials to be absolutely homogeneous. Such an island would
    be subject to all the forces ordinarily operating on land surfaces.
    The chief agency tending to modify land surfaces is atmospheric
    precipitation. It will be assumed that the rain falls on the surface
    of the island with absolute equality at all points, and that all other
    forces which affect it operate equally everywhere.</p>

  <p>The rain falling on a land area disappears in various ways; part of it
    evaporates, part of it sinks, and part of it runs off over the surface.
    If the island be composed of fine and unconsolidated materials, such
    as clay, the water which runs off over the surface will carry sediment
    down to the sea. If the island be composed of solid rock instead,
    exposure to the air will cause it to decay, and the products of decay,
    such as sand and mud, will suffer a like fate.</p>

  <p>For the sake of a clear understanding of the processes involved, two
    cases may be postulated; one in which the waters of the sea remove the
    sediment washed down from the hypothetical island as fast as it reaches
    the shore, and one in which they allow it to accumulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> without let or
    hindrance. In both cases the wear of the waves will be neglected.</p>

  <p>1. In the first case the water flowing off over the surface (the
    <i>run-off</i>) will descend equally in all directions. It will
    constitute a continuous sheet of surface-water, and both its volume
    and its velocity will be the same at all points equally distant
    from the summit. Erosion accomplished by sheets of running water,
    as distinct from streams, is <i>sheet</i> (or <i>sheet-flood</i>)
    <i>erosion</i>.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Since the material of the surface is homogeneous,
    the wear effected by the water will be equal at all points where its
    velocity and volume are equal. For obvious reasons the depth of the
    run-off will increase from summit to base. The gradient (slope) also
    increases in the same direction, and the increase of volume and of
    gradient conspire to augment the velocity of the water, and therefore
    of the wear effected by it. If the thin sheet of water starting from
    the top of the island with relatively low velocity be able to wash
    off even a little fine material from the surface, the thicker sheet
    farther down the slope, moving with greater velocity, will be able to
    carry away more of the same sort of material, and the increase will
    be progressive from summit to base. It follows, therefore, that the
    surface will be worn equally at points equally distant from the summit,
    but unequally at points unequally distant from it. The first shower
    which falls on the island may be conceived to wash off from its surface
    a very thin sheet of material, but a sheet which increases in thickness
    from top to bottom. The run-off will not be stopped immediately on
    reaching the sea, but will displace the sea-water to some slight
    depth, and wear the surface some trivial distance below the normal
    level of the sea. The result of successive showers working in the same
    way through a long period of time will be to diminish the area of the
    island and to steepen its slopes. The results of a considerable period
    of erosion under these conditions are shown <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>diagrammatically in <a href="#fig037"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    37</a>, which illustrates both the diminution in area which the island has
    suffered, and the increase in the angle of its slopes. Immediately
    about it, at the stage represented by <i>aa</i>, <a href="#fig037"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 37</a>, there is
    a narrow marginal platform, or submerged terrace, in place of the
    land area which has been worn away at or just below the level of the
    sea. Long successions of rains working in the same way will give the
    island steeper slopes, a smaller area, and a wider marginal terrace.
    Successive stages are shown by the lines <i>bb</i> and <i>cc</i>, <a href="#fig037"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    37</a>.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig037">

      rain erosion on an island where there is no deposition or wave erosion

      while <i>aa</i>, <i>bb</i>, and <i>cc</i> represent successive surfaces
      developed by sheet erosion, on the supposition that no material is
      deposited along the shores.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If rain falls on such an island until it completes the work which
    it is possible for running water to do, the island will be reduced
    essentially to the level of the sea, and in its place there will be a
    plain, the area of which will be equal to that of the original island.
    Its central point will be at the level of the sea, and its borders a
    trifling distance below it (<a href="#fig038"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 38</a>). The island is gone, and in its
    place there is a plain as low as running water can wear it. Other
    agencies might come in to defeat the result just outlined, but if the
    island did not rise or sink after its formation, rain falling upon it
    would, <i>under the conditions specified</i>, finally bring about the
    result which has been sketched. The plain (<a href="#fig038"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 38</a>) which succeeds the
    island is a <i>base-level of erosion</i>, though this term is also
    used in other ways. Under these conditions the slope of the land would
    remain convex at all stages, but the convex erosion profile of the land
    would meet a nearly straight line just below sea-level. The relative
    lengths of these two elements of the profile, the curve above and the
    straight line below, vary as erosion progresses, the convex portion
    becoming shorter and the other longer, The two parts of the profile
    taken together are concave upward at the lower end all the time, and
    for a greater distance from its lower end in all the advanced stages of
    erosion (<a href="#fig037"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 37</a>).</p>

      of rain erosion under the conditions specified in the text. The diagram
      expresses the final result of the processes suggested by <a href="#fig037"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 37</a>.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the destruction of the land under these conditions <i>neither
    valleys nor hills would be developed</i>, nor would the topography of
    the land be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> fashioned to correspond with the surfaces with which we
    are familiar.</p>

  <p>It is to be distinctly borne in mind that the foregoing is a
    hypothetical case; it is not probable that such an island ever existed,
    or ever will; but that does not diminish the value of the illustration,
    since the principles involved are operating on every land mass, though
    in less simple relations.</p>

  <p>2. The second case differs from the first in that the sediment washed
    down from the land is deposited about its borders. This results in
    the building up of a marginal platform, as shown in <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 39–41</a>. As
    erosion goes on more sediment is washed down and deposited, partly on
    the narrow marginal shelf which has already been developed, and partly
    on its outer slope, as shown in the figures. The marginal flat is thus
    extended beyond the original shores of the island on the one hand, and
    toward its center on the other. As it develops, its inner portion,
    and indeed all except its outer edge (<i>ab</i>, <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig039">40</a> and <a href="#fig039">41</a>),
    will be gradually built up above the level of the water. This marginal
    lowland is developed at a level as low as running water, <i>under the
    conditions then and there present</i>, can reduce the land. Such a
    surface may be said to be at <i>grade</i>, since running water neither
    wears it down nor builds it up. Its angle of slope is a function of (1)
    the volume of the water running over it, and (2) of the load which the
    water carries.</p>

      lines represent the original surface. The several diagrams represent
      successive stages in the process.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Since the marginal plain of the above illustration extends beyond the
    original shore of the island, the area of land is increased, though
    both its average elevation and its mass (above water) are reduced. In
    case destructive processes did not operate on the marginal graded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
    plain the spreading and lowering suggested by <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig039">39</a> and <a href="#fig039">40</a> would go
    on until the central mass of the island was brought down to a gradient
    in harmony with that of the gently sloping border, as shown in <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    41</a>. When this had been accomplished there would be a relatively large
    land area with low slopes (<a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 41</a>) in place of the smaller area with
    steeper ones (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig039">39</a> and <a href="#fig039">40</a>). The basal part of the larger
    island from the center to the original margin would be made up of the
    original material in its original position (unshaded part of <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 41</a>).
    Its surface would be covered, least deeply near its center and most
    deeply near the original margin, with débris gradually shifted from
    higher levels, as shown in <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 41</a>.</p>

  <p>Were such an island as that shown in <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 41</a> once formed, the rain
    falling on it, and flowing off over its surface, would carry off its
    surface soil and spread it about the shores. Though the surface of the
    marginal flat of <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 40</a> was as low as running water could bring it at
    the time it was developed, the conditions of erosion have changed by
    the time the land reaches the conditions shown in <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 41</a>, and the same
    amount of rainfall may now be effective in erosion. In the first case
    (<a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 40</a>) the water descending from the higher part of the land brought
    down sediment and started across the flat with a load. Its energy was
    consumed in transporting what it had, not in getting new material. In
    the second case (<a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 41</a>) the water flowing over the gently sloping
    surface has no initial load, and its energy is therefore available for
    erosion. Under continued rainfall, the area of the land shown in <a href="#fig039"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    41</a> would be increased as before by successive marginal deposits (see
    <a href="#fig042"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 42</a>), and at the same time its average height would be reduced. The
    lowering and enlarging of the island would continue until the whole
    surface was brought so nearly to the level of the sea that water would
    cease to run over it with sufficient velocity to carry away even the
    fine material of its surface. Such a surface, brought down as low as
    running water can degrade it, is also (see <a href="#Page_57"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57</a>) a <i>base-level</i>.
    It will be seen from the foregoing illustrations that a <i>graded
    surface</i> may pass into a <i>base-level</i>, with no sharper line of
    demarkation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> than that which separates a mature man from an old one. In
    this case, as in the preceding, the island has been base-leveled, but
    still without the formation of valleys or hills.</p>

      the continuation of the processes shown in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 39–41.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Both the preceding hypothetical cases make it clear that, from the
    point of view of erosion, every drop of water which runs off over
    the surface of the land has for its mission the getting of the land
    into the sea. Under ordinary conditions surface drainage must fail to
    bring a land area altogether to sea-level, the absolute base-level of
    subaërial forces; but it is not simply the water which runs off over
    the surface which degrades the land. That which sinks beneath the
    surface contributes to the same end by slowly dissolving mineral matter
    below the surface, and finally carrying it to the sea. In this way the
    reduction of land areas to sea-level may be completed.</p>

  <p>The rain-water which evaporates from the surface without sinking
    beneath it does not effect much wear; but the water thus evaporated is
    subject to reprecipitation, so that, in the long run, it may assist
    in the work which has been sketched. Thus it is not simply the waters
    which run off over the surface of the land, but all which fall upon it,
    which unite to compass its destruction.</p>

  <h4><i>The Development of Valleys.</i></h4>

  <p><b>By the growth of gullies.—</b>Had the slopes of the hypothetical
    island not been absolutely uniform the processes of erosion would
    have been different. Let the departure from uniformity be supposed to
    consist of a single slight meridional depression near the base of the
    island (<a href="#fig043"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 43</a>). As the rain falls it will no longer run off equally
    in all directions. A greater volume will flow through the depression
    than over other parts of the surface having the same altitude, and the
    greater volume of water along this line will give greater velocity,
    greater velocity will occasion greater erosion, and greater erosion
    will deepen the depression. The immediate result is a <i>gully</i> or
    <i>wash</i> (<a href="#fig044"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 44</a>). So soon as the gully is started it tends still
    further to concentrate drainage in itself, and is thereby enlarged.
    The water which enters it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> from the sides widens it; that which enters
    at its head lengthens it by causing its upper end to recede; and all
    which flows through it, so long as its bottom is above base-level,
    deepens it. The enlarged gully will gather more water to itself, and,
    as before, increased volume means increased velocity, and increased
    velocity increased erosion. As the gully grows, therefore, its
    increased size becomes the occasion of still further enlargement.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 43.—Diagram showing a slight meridional
      depression in the surface of an otherwise even-sloped island.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Continued growth transforms the gully into a ravine, though between a
    gully and a ravine there is no distinct line of demarkation. But growth
    does not stop with ravine-hood. Water from every shower gathers in
    the ravine, and, flowing through it, increases its length, width, and
    depth, until it reaches such proportions that the term <i>ravine</i> is
    laid aside, as childhood names are, and the depression becomes a valley.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig044">
    <img class="illowp56" src="images/fig044.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 44.—Diagram illustrating the development
      of a gully, starting from the condition shown in <a href="#fig043"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 43</a>.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It was assumed in the preceding paragraphs that the single depression
    in the slope was meridional and low on the slope, but almost any sort
    of depression in almost any position would bring about a similar
    result, since it would lead to concentration of the run-off. Had the
    original surface been interrupted by ridges instead of depressions,
    the effect on valley development would have been much the same, for a
    ridge, like a depression, would, in almost any position, occasion the
    concentration of the run-off, and so the development of valleys. Under
    the conditions represented in <a href="#fig044"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 44</a> the lengthening of the drainage
    depression is effected chiefly at its upper end, the head of the valley
    working its way farther and farther back into the land. This method
    of elongation is known as <i>head erosion</i>. But the lengthening of
    the valley is not always wholly by head erosion. The gully normally
    begins where concentration of run-off begins, and if this were not at
    sea-level, the gully might be lengthening at both ends at the same
    time. This would have been the case, for example, had the original
    depression of <a href="#fig043"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 43</a> been half-way up the slope of the island.</p>

  <p>If while the slopes of the island were absolutely uniform its surface
    material failed of homogeneity, the result would be much the same as
    if the slopes were unequal. If the material lying along a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> certain
    meridian of the island be slightly softer than that over the rest of
    the surface, the run-off, which would at the outset be equal on all
    sides, would effect more erosion along the line of the less resistant
    material than elsewhere. The result would be a depression along this
    line, and, once started, the depression would be a cause of its own
    growth. If the soft material were disposed in any way other than
    that indicated, the final result would be much the same, for it
    would quickly give origin to a depression which would lead to the
    concentration of the surface-waters, and this is the condition for the
    development of a gully, a ravine, and finally a valley.</p>

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 45.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of
      sheet and stream erosion on the outline of an island when no deposition
      takes place about its borders. The dotted line represents the original
      outline of the island, the full line its border at a later time. The
      stream develops a reëntrant (bay) in the outline.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the presence of sufficient rainfall, either heterogeneity of slope
    or of material will therefore occasion the development of valleys. If
    the lack of uniformity appears at but a single point there will be but
    a single valley. If it appears at many points the number of valleys
    will be large. Since it is incredible that a land mass of perfectly
    homogeneous material and of absolutely uniform slopes ever existed,
    it is believed that every land mass, affected for any considerable
    length of time by rain, has had valleys developed in it. The degree of
    heterogeneity of material and slope is usually so great as to lead to
    the development of many valleys, even on areas which are not large;
    but for the sake of emphasizing the simpler elements of the complex
    processes of stream work, the hypothetical case of an island with but
    a single valley, and that without tributaries, may first be studied.
    Under these conditions two cases may be considered, the one where there
    is no deposition about the island, and the other where deposition takes
    place.</p>

  <p>1. If all the material eroded from the surface of such an island, both
    in and out of the valley, were carried well beyond the borders of the
    land before being deposited, the edge of the island would recede<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> from
    its original position toward the center, as illustrated by <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig037">37</a> and
    <a href="#fig045">45</a>; but the recession would be most rapid where the valley joins the
    sea (<a href="#fig045"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 45</a>). At this point therefore a reëntrant would be developed
    (<i>a</i>, <a href="#fig045"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 45</a>), and the island would lose its circular outline.
    Continued erosion would cause the shore-line to retreat on all sides,
    but fastest at the lower end of the valley, and the final result would
    be a base-level differing from that developed under the conditions
    specified on <a href="#Page_60"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 60</a>, in that the last part to be brought low would not
    be the center of the original island.</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp45" id="fig046">
    <img src="images/fig046.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 46.—Diagram showing the outline of an
      island as modified by sheet and stream erosion where eroded material
      is deposited at the shore. The dotted line represents the original
      outline; the full line, a later one. The excess of deposition at the
      end of the valley causes a projection of land into the sea.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Under the foregoing conditions the profile of that part of the valley
    which is above sea-level (<i>cb</i>) would be convex, following the
    analogy of sheet erosion on a hypothetical island of uniform slopes
    and homogeneous material with no marginal deposition. Its side slopes,
    likewise developed under the influence of running water augmented in
    volume from top to bottom, would also be convex.</p>

  <p>2. If the sediment washed down from the land is deposited about its
    borders, both the outline of the island and the profile of the valley
    will be altered. Deposition at the debouchure of the valley follows
    the same principles as deposition elsewhere; but if all the sediment
    brought to the sea be deposited at the shore, the seaward extension of
    the land by deposition would be more rapid opposite the valley than
    elsewhere, and the island would lose its circular outline, and develop
    some such form as is shown in <a href="#fig046"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 46</a>. In this case the profile of the
    upper end of the valley, and the upper parts of its side slopes, as
    well as the upper parts of the extra-valley slopes of the island, are
    convex (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig039">39</a> and <a href="#fig039">40</a>); but the convexity above is exchanged
    for concavity below, the change beginning at the point where downward
    erosion of the descending waters is checked. As a valley lengthens, the
    larger part of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> profile becomes concave (compare the profiles of
    <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig039">39</a> to <a href="#fig039">41</a>), but the extreme upper end still remains convex. Since
    the side slopes of a valley are much shorter than its lengthwise slope,
    a larger proportion remains convex. Under the conditions here discussed
    the change from convexity above to concavity below would begin at about
    the point where deposition begins.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

      meridional valleys developing in a circular island. The valleys are all
      young and narrow. All are making deposits at their debouchures.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The deposition at the debouchure of the valley, and later above the
    debouchure, will follow the same course as about the island under the
    conditions already discussed (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_61">61</a>, <a href="#Page_62">62</a>).</p>

  <p><b>Limits of growth.—</b>In all cases there are limits in depth,
    length, and width, beyond which a valley may not grow. In depth it may
    reach base-level. At the coast, base-level is sea-level,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but inland
    it rises by a gentle gradient. In length, the valley will grow as long
    as its head continues to work inland. In the case represented by <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>
    <a href="#fig045">45</a> and <a href="#fig046">46</a> the head of the valley would not cease to advance when the
    center of the island was reached, though beyond that point head erosion
    would not be more rapid than lateral erosion on either side. If but
    a single valley affected a land area the limit toward which it would
    tend, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>and beyond which it could never pass, would be the length of the
    land area in the direction of the valley’s axis. In width, a valley is
    increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> by the side cutting of the stream, by the wash of the rain
    which falls on its slopes, and by the action of gravity which tends to
    carry down to the bottom of the slope the material which is loosened
    above by any process whatsoever. If there be but one valley in a land
    area its limiting width is scarcely less than the width of the land
    itself.</p>

      <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> successively. If erosion were unequal on the two
      sides, the divide would be shifted.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Had there been several initial meridional depressions instead of one
    in the island, or had there been several meridional belts where the
    material of the surface was less resistant than elsewhere, several
    valleys would have been developed, converging toward the center (<a href="#fig047"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    47</a>). If the conditions were such as to allow of the equal development
    of valleys on all sides of the island, each would be lengthened by head
    erosion until it reached the center of the island, where the permanent
    divide between their heads would be established. Each would be widened
    by all the processes which widen valleys, and their widening would
    narrow the intervening areas (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig048">48</a> and <a href="#fig049">49</a>). Under conditions of
    equal erosion the limits of width for each valley would be the centers
    of the ridges on either side, and here the divides between them would
    be permanently established. Though erosion would continue even after
    the crest of the ridge had been narrowed to a line, the permanence of
    the divide would follow from the fact that erosion would be equal on
    both sides of this line, and its effect would be to lower the divide,
    but not to shift it horizontally (<a href="#fig050"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 50</a>). The limits in length and
    width are therefore not the same where there are several valleys as
    where there is but one. The limit in depth, however, remains the same,
    and the final result of erosion, proceeding along these lines, would
    be the base-leveling of the land, leaving a plain but slightly above
    sea-level. The plain would not be absolutely flat, though its relief
    would be very slight, and the higher parts would be along the lines of
    the divides between the streams (<a href="#fig051"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 51</a>. Compare also <a href="#fig042"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 42</a>). Many
    valleys would occasion more rapid degradation than few, and the period
    of base-leveling would be correspondingly shortened.</p>

  <p>Had the initial depressions which gave origin to the valleys had
    positions other than meridional, the valleys would have had other
    and less regularly radial courses, but the final result of their
    development would have been the same.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

  <p>It is not to be inferred that the method of valley development which
    has been sketched is the only one. The processes of valley development
    are complex, and the history of some valleys has run a different
    course; yet the processes outlined above are in operation in all cases,
    and they were probably the most important ones in the development of
    the first drainage system on any land surface. As will be seen in the
    sequel the history of valleys is subject to serious accidents, and they
    are often of such a nature as to mask the simplicity of the more normal
    processes.</p>

      not yet to base-level.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The permanent stream.</b>—From the foregoing discussion, it is seen
    that a valley may be developed by the run-off of successive showers. If
    supplied only from this source surface streams would cease to flow soon
    after the rain ceased to fall, and a valley might attain considerable
    size without possessing a permanent stream. How does the valley
    developed by the run-off of successive showers come to have a permanent
    stream? The answer to this question involves a brief consideration of
    that part of the rainfall which sinks beneath the surface.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

  <p>If wells be sunk in a flat region of uniform structure and composition
    the water in them is generally found to stand at a nearly common
    level. The meaning of this fact is not far to seek. If a hole 60 feet
    deep fills with water up to a point 20 feet from the surface, it is
    because the material in which the well is sunk is full of water up
    to that level. When the well is dug the water leaks into it, filling
    the hole up to the level to which the rock (or subsoil) is itself
    full. This level, below which the rock and subsoil (down to unknown
    depths) are full of water, is known as the <i>ground-water level</i>,
    <i>ground-water surface</i>, or <i>water-table</i>.</p>

  <p>The ground-water level fluctuates. In a wet season it rises, because
    more water has fallen and sunk beneath the soil; but several processes
    at once conspire to bring it down again. Where there is growing
    vegetation its roots draw up water from beneath, and evaporation also
    goes on independently of vegetation. The water is drawn out through
    wells and runs out through openings. It may also flow underground from
    one region to another where the ground-water surface is lower. All
    these processes depress the ground-water surface.</p>

  <figure class="figright illowp45 clear" id="fig052">
    <img src="images/fig052.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 52.—Diagram illustrating the fluctuation
      of a ground-water surface. <i>a</i> = wet-weather ground-water level;
      <i>b</i> = ground-water level during drought. Well No. 1 will contain
      water during the wet season, but will go dry in times of drought. Well
      No. 2 will be permanent.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A well sunk to such a level as to be supplied with abundant water
    in a wet season may go dry during a period of drought because the
    ground-water level is depressed below its bottom. Thus either well
    shown in <a href="#fig052"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 52</a> will have water during a wet season when the
    water-level is at <i>a</i>; but well No. 1 will go dry when the water
    surface is depressed to <i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>The principles applicable to wells are applicable to valleys. When
    a valley has been deepened until its bottom reaches below the
    ground-water level, water seeps or flows into it from the sides. The
    valley is then no longer dependent on the run-off of showers for a
    stream. It will be readily seen that at some stage in its development,
    the bottom of a valley may be below the ground-water level of a
    wet season without being below that of a dry one. Thus the valley
    represented in cross-section by the line 2–2, in <a href="#fig053"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 53</a>, will have
    a stream when the ground-water level is at <i>aa</i>, but none when
    this level is depressed to <i>bb</i>. If the rainfall of the year were
    concentrated in a single wet season, the intermittent stream would
    flow not only during that season, but for so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> long a time afterward
    as the ground-water level remained well above the valley bottom. In
    regions subject to frequent and short periods of heavy precipitation,
    alternating with droughts, the periods of intermittent flow may be
    many and short. Since the precipitation of many regions varies greatly
    from year to year, it follows that a stream may flow continuously one
    year and be intermittent the next. Many valleys in various parts of
    the earth are now in the stage of development where their streams are
    intermittent.</p>

  <p>As a valley containing an intermittent stream becomes deeper, the
    periods when it is dry become shorter, and when it has been sunk below
    the lowest ground-water level, it will have a permanent stream (3, <a href="#fig053"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    53</a>). Since a valley normally develops headward, its lower and older
    portion is likely to acquire a permanent stream, while its upper and
    younger part has only an intermittent one (<a href="#fig047"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 47</a> and <a href="#fig001"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1</a>, <a href="#plate_III"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> III</a>,
    near Anthony, Kan. The intermittent part of the stream is indicated
    by the dotted blue line). For the same reason the head of a stream is
    likely to be farther up the valley in wet weather than in dry. So soon
    as a valley gets a permanent stream, the process of enlargement goes
    on without the interruption to which it was subject when the supply of

    arise where a stream heads in a region of abundant precipitation, and
    flows thence through an arid tract where the ground-water level is low,
    and evaporation great. In such cases, evaporation and absorption may
    dissipate the water gathered above, and the stream disappears (<a href="#plate_IIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2,

  <p><b>Other modes of valley development.—</b>If as a new area of land
    emerges from the sea its surface has a depression without an outlet,
    and such an assumption is by no means improbable, the depression would
    be filled with sea-water. The inflowing water from the surrounding
    land might fill the basin to overflowing, and the outflow, finding
    exit at the lowest point in the rim of the basin, would flow thence
    toward the sea. Such a stream would develop a valley, the history of
    which would be somewhat different from that which has been sketched.
    Instead of developing headward from the sea, the valley would be in
    process of excavation all the way from the initial basin to the sea at
    the same time (<a href="#fig054"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 54</a>). The upper end of the valley might ultimately
    be cut to the level of the bottom of the basin, when the lake would
    disappear. The head of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> valley might then work back across the
    former site of the lake into the territory beyond. Valleys might have
    developed above the lake before it was drained, and after this event,
    such valleys would make connections with the valley below (<a href="#fig055"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 55</a>). A
    valley developed in this manner is not simply a gully grown big by head
    erosion, and the valley would not precede the stream.</p>

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 54.—Diagram to show how a valley may be
      developing all the way from a water-filled basin (lake) to the sea at
      the same time. Small valleys leading to the lake are also developing.

      site of the former lake have united.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If a surface of land were notably irregular before valleys were
    developed in it, there might be many lakes, and the flow from a higher
    lake might pass to a lower. If the lakes were ultimately drained, the
    several sections of the valley would be joined to one another without
    intervening basins. In certain regions, especially those which have
    been affected by continental ice-sheets, this has been a common method
    of valley development in <i>post-glacial</i> time. In this case also
    the stream precedes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> its valley, and not the valley its stream. Many
    post-glacial valleys, on the other hand, antedated their permanent
    streams, as in the cases first described.</p>

      development described in the text.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If the gradient of a slope on which valleys are to develop is notably
    unequal, though without basins, the development of valleys may follow
    somewhat different lines. If on emergence the seaward part of a new
    land area assumes the form of a plain, bordered landward by a steeper
    slope (<a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>), the most notable early growth of the valleys would
    be on the latter. The run-off would develop gullies on the steep
    slope, but on reaching the plain below the velocity of the water
    would be checked, and it would drop much of the detritus washed down
    from above. This deposition would build up (aggrade) the surface,
    and much or even all the water might sink into and seep through the
    débris thus deposited, and disappear altogether from the surface, as
    at <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>. This would be most likely to occur where the
    débris is abundant and coarse, and the precipitation slight. If the
    water disappears at the base of the mountain (see <a href="#plate_IIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> III</a>), the
    early growth of the valley may be confined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> the steep slope remote
    from the sea (<i>ab</i>, <a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>); but on the slope where the valley
    is growing there will be headward lengthening, as in the general case
    already considered. If the surface drainage does not disappear at the
    base of the steep slope, the run-off will find its way over the plain
    along the lowest accessible route to the sea (<i>de</i>, <a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>). In
    this case the valley may be growing throughout its length at the same
    time.</p>

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 57.—Diagram representing the further
      development of the valleys <i>fg</i> and <i>hi</i> in <a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>. The head
      of the latter (<a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>) has worked back until it has reached the lower
      end of the former.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The conditions represented by <i>ab</i>, <a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>, may be no more
    than temporary. Sooner or later a valley developing headward across
    the plain (<i>hi</i>, <a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>) may provide a channel for the water
    descending from the higher land beyond. In this case the valley
    develops in sections, the one on the slope above, the other on the
    plain below, and their union (compare <i>fghi</i>, <a href="#fig056"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 56</a>, with <a href="#fig057"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    57</a>) results from their growth.</p>

  <p>The principles here sketched have been in operation wherever land
    areas were so elevated as to give rise to unequal slopes, and this has
    perhaps been the rule rather than the exception. The results effected
    by the operation of these principles would of course be dependent on
    the varieties of slope, on the abruptness with which a slope of one
    gradient gave place to another, on the texture of the rock, the amount
    and distribution of precipitation, etc., etc.</p>

  <p>In the preceding paragraphs the lengthening of a valley at its upper
    end by head erosion has been repeatedly referred to. If all valleys
    began their development at the sea and lengthened headward, it might
    seem that their seaward ends should be their oldest parts; but since
    the development of valleys is begun somewhat promptly after the land
    appears above the sea, and since the emergence is generally gradual,
    that part of a valley which is at the seashore at one time may be far
    inland a little later, because the land has been extended seaward.
    On an emerging land area<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> therefore the normal growth of a valley
    involves its lengthening at its lower end as well as at its upper. The
    lengthening of a valley, or at least the lengthening of a stream, also
    takes place at its lower end if the land in which it lies is being
    extended seaward by deposition.</p>

  <p><b>Structural valleys.—</b>In mountain regions valleys are sometimes
    formed by the uplift of parallel mountain folds, leaving a depression
    between (<a href="#fig058"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 58</a>). Drainage will appropriate such a valley so that it
    becomes in some sense a river valley. But it is not a river valley in
    the sense in which the term has been used in the preceding pages. It is
    rather a <i>structural valley</i>. In its bottom a river valley may be
    developed (<i>a</i>, <a href="#fig058"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 58</a>).</p>

    under which valleys develop, but they suffice for the present.</p>

      <span>Figures to show why the head of a gully (and therefore a valley)
      departs from a direct course.</span></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The courses of valleys.—</b>River valleys are rarely straight. To
    understand why they are crooked it is only necessary to understand the
    methods by which they grow. In so far as a river valley is a gully
    grown big, that is, in so far as its length is the result of head
    erosion, its course was determined by the course of the antecedent
    gully. If in the case shown in <a href="#fig059"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 59</a> the slope of the surface above
    the head of the gully is uniform, its material homogeneous, and the
    rainfall everywhere equal, more water will come into the gully from
    the direction <i>a</i> than from any other. In this case there would
    be more wear in the direct line of its extension than elsewhere, and
    the head would advance in a straight line. But if there be inequalities
    of slope about the head of a gully at any stage of its development
    more water may come in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> from some direction other than that in the
    direct line of its extension. In <a href="#fig059"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 59</a>, for example, more water may
    enter from the direction of <i>b</i> than from that of <i>a</i>. Since
    most wear is likely to be affected along the line of greatest inflow,
    the head of the gully will be turned in that direction (<a href="#fig059"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 60</a>).
    Started in this course it will continue in the new direction so long
    as erosion in this line is greater than that elsewhere; but whenever
    the configuration of the surface causes more water to enter the head of
    the gully from some direction other than that in which it is headed,
    the line of axial growth is again changed, as toward <i>c</i>, <a href="#fig059"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    60</a>. Since new land surfaces are probably more or less undulatory,
    crookedness should be the rule among valleys developed from gullies by
    head erosion. Streams and valleys the courses of which are determined
    by the original slope of the land are said to be <i>consequent</i>.</p>

    <img src="images/fig061.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 61.—Diagram illustrating the development
      of two equal gullies from the head of one.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Inequalities of material, leading to unequal rates of erosion, effect
    the same result, in the absence of inequalities of slope. If at any
    stage of a valley’s development erosion were equal in two directions
    at its head, and at the same time greater than at points between, two
    gullies would result (<a href="#fig061"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 61</a>) diverging from the point in question.</p>

  <p>In the case of a valley developed by overflow from a lake its course is
    determined by the lowest line of flow to which the water has access. If
    this line be straight the valley will be straight; if it is crooked, as
    it generally is, the valley is crooked also.</p>

  <p><b>The development of tributaries.—</b>Thus far valleys leading
    immediately to the sea have been considered, and no account taken
    of tributaries. As a matter of fact most considerable valleys have
    numerous tributaries. It is now in order to inquire into their mode of
    development.</p>

  <p>So soon as a gully is started, the water flowing into it from either
    side wears back the slopes. The least inequality of slope, or the least
    variation in the character of the material, is sufficient to make the
    lateral erosion unequal at different points, and unequal erosion in
    the slopes results in the development of tributary gullies. The oldest
    tributaries may be nearly as old as the main which they join, and from
    which they developed, for the possibilities of unequal side erosion
    exist as soon as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> gully is opened. While the main gully is developing
    into a ravine, and the ravine into a valley, the tributary gullies
    are likewise developing into maturer stages. Tributary to a young
    valley, therefore, there may be gullies near its head, ravines in its
    middle course, and small valleys along its oldest portion. It is not
    to be understood, however, that the oldest tributaries are necessarily
    the largest, for because of more favorable conditions for growth the
    younger tributaries often outstrip the older.</p>

  <figure class="figright illowp29" id="fig062">
    <img src="images/fig062.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 62.—Diagram to illustrate the oblique
      position of a tributary gully at its inception, and its later normal
      change of direction.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The position of tributaries with reference to their mains is worthy
    of note. The water flowing down a slope follows the line of steepest
    descent. A gully is usually wider at its lower end, and narrower at its
    upper. Wherever this is true the line of steepest descent down its side
    is not a line perpendicular to its axis, but a line slightly oblique to
    it (<i>ef</i>, <a href="#fig062"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 62</a>), and oblique in such a direction that it meets
    the axis with an obtuse angle below and an acute angle above. It is in
    the direction corresponding to this line that tributary gullies tend
    to develop. Thus at the inception of its history a tributary gully is
    likely to join its main with an angle slightly acute on the up-stream
    side. If the tributary did not begin until after its main was farther
    advanced this tendency would be less and less pronounced. Inequalities
    of material or slope would often counteract this tendency, which, at
    best, would cause the courses of tributaries to depart but little from
    perpendicularity to their mains.</p>

  <p>After the head of a tributary has worked back from the immediate slope
    of its main every condition which determines the course of a gully
    is likely to affect it, and it is by no means certain that it will
    continue to lengthen in the direction in which it started. Since the
    general slope of the surface into which the tributary works is likely
    to be seaward, more water is likely to enter from the landward than
    from the seaward side of its head, so that, except where there are
    notable irregularities of slope, its tendency will be to turn more and
    more toward the direction of its main (<i>efg</i>, <a href="#fig062"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 62</a>).</p>

  <p>In depth the tributary is always limited by its main. The principles
    which determine the length and width of a main valley determine also
    the length and width of a tributary (see <a href="#Page_67"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 67</a> et seq.).</p>

  <h3>A CYCLE OF EROSION. ITS STAGES.</h3>

  <p>From what has preceded it is clear that the topography of a region
    undergoing erosion will change greatly from time to time. The first
    effect of erosion is to roughen the surface by cutting out valleys,
    leaving ridges and hills. The final effect is to make it smooth again
    by cutting the ridges and hills down to the level of the valleys.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig063">

      the surface by valley erosion. The successive cross profiles of the
      valleys are represented by the lines 1–1, 1–1′, 2–2, 2–2′, etc.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The base-level of erosion has already been defined; but the mode of
    its development may now be illustrated in the light of the preceding
    discussion. Suppose a land surface affected by a series of parallel
    young valleys without tributaries (<a href="#fig063"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 63</a>). Between them there is
    a series of upland plateaus. The profile of the surface between two
    adjacent valleys is represented in section by the uppermost line in
    <a href="#fig064"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 64</a>. As the valleys are widened from 1–1 and 1,′–1′, to 2–2 and
    2′–2′, the intervening plateau is correspondingly narrowed. When the
    valleys have attained the form represented by 3–3 and 3′–3′, the
    intervening upland has been narrowed to a ridge, <i>a</i>, and the
    valley flats have become wide. With continued erosion the ridge will
    be lowered (to <i>b</i> and below), and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> in time the surface will
    approach a plain. In this condition it is known as a <i>peneplain</i>
    (an “almost-plain”). Finally, when running water has done its utmost,
    the ridges will be essentially obliterated and a base-leveled plain
    (<i>e</i>, <i>e′</i>, <i>e″</i>) results. The figure expresses the fact
    that the base-level develops laterally from the axis of the valley. It
    also develops headward from the seaward end of the valley. Similarly,
    taking into account all the valleys which affect it, the seaward margin
    of a base-leveled plain is developed first, and thence it extends
    itself inland.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig065">
    <img class="illowp80" src="images/fig065.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 65.—Diagram showing the dissection of the
      upland shown in <a href="#fig064"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 64</a> by tributary valleys.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Tributaries are tolerably sure to develop along each main valley. The
    heads of the tributaries work back across the uplands between the main
    valleys, dissecting them into secondary ridges (<a href="#fig065"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 65</a>). Tributaries
    will develop on the tributaries, and these tertiary valleys dissect
    the secondary ridges into those of a lower order. This process of
    tributary development goes on until drainage lines of the fourth,
    fifth, sixth, and higher orders are formed (<a href="#fig066"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 66</a>). Since the process
    of valley development under such circumstances is also the process
    of ridge dissection, a stage is presently reached where the ridges
    are cut into such short sections that they cease to be ridges, and
    become hills instead. Even then the processes of erosion do not stop,
    for the rain-water falling on the hills washes the loose material
    from their surfaces, and starts it on its seaward journey. Thus the
    “everlasting hills” themselves are lowered, and, given time enough,
    will be carried to the sea. Under these conditions, as under those
    already discussed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> the final result of stream erosion is the reduction
    of the land to base-level. The base-leveled surface, as before, would
    not be absolutely flat. The area reduced by each stream will have a
    slight gradient down-stream, and from each lateral divide toward the
    axis of the valley. The crests of the scarcely perceptible elevations
    which remain will be in the position of the former divides, and these
    will be highest where most distant from the sea by the course which
    this part of the drainage took. Even the insensible divides between
    streams flowing in a common direction may disappear, for when valleys
    have reached their limits in depth, their streams do not cease to cut
    laterally. Meandering in their flat-bottomed valleys, they often reach
    and undercut the divides (<a href="#plate_VII"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> VII</a>), whether they be high or low. By
    <i>lateral planation</i>, therefore, the divides between streams may be
    entirely eaten away.</p>

      orders developed from the conditions sketched in the text.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It has now been seen that by whatever method erosion by running water
    proceeds, whether there be many valleys, or few or none, the final
    result of subaërial erosion must be the production of a base-level. It
    has also been seen that the base-level is first developed at the lower
    ends of the main streams, and that it extends itself systematically
    up the main valleys and up all tributaries. The time involved in the
    reduction of a land area to base-level is a <i>cycle of erosion</i>.</p>

  <p>It will have been evident from the preceding pages that the terms
    “grade,” “graded plain,” and “base-level” and “base-leveled plain,”
    are somewhat variously, and therefore somewhat confusingly, used.
    “Grade is a condition of essential balance between corrasion and
    deposition.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> A graded valley is one in which deposition and
    corrasion are, in the vertical sense, balanced. Its angle of slope is
    most variable, and is dependent on the capacity of the stream for work,
    and on the work it has to do. A weak river must have a higher gradient
    than a strong one; a stream with much sediment must have a higher
    gradient than one with little, and a stream with a load of coarse
    material must have a higher gradient than one with a load of fine.
    Thus the graded valley of the lower Mississippi has an inappreciable
    angle of slope, but the graded valleys of many of its tributaries have
    slopes of hundreds of feet per mile. Since both the size of the stream
    and the amount and coarseness of its load at a given place vary from
    time to time, it is clear that the inclination of a graded valley
    must vary also, and further, that it must be in process of continual
    readjustment. With the changing conditions of advancing years the slope
    of a graded valley normally decreases. The same principles apply to
    graded surfaces outside of valleys.</p>

  <p>In the continual readjustment of grades incident to a river’s normal
    history the land is brought nearer and nearer to sea-level without
    ceasing to be at grade. When the inclination of a graded surface
    becomes so low that it is sensibly flat, the surface may be said to be
    at <i>base-level</i>, although this does not mean that the surface can
    never be degraded further. If the term be used in this way, it is clear
    that there is no sharp line of distinction between a graded surface and
    a base-leveled surface, and as the terms are now commonly applied no
    such distinction exists.</p>

  <p>If the term base-level were made synonymous with sea-level, as has
    been proposed,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> the term might as well be discarded, for sea-level
    could always be used in its stead. Furthermore, streams often erode
    below sea-level. The bottom of the channel of the Mississippi is below
    sea-level for some 400 miles above its debouchure, and locally (Fort
    Jackson) it is nearly 250 feet below. This deep channel is the result
    of the erosive activity of the stream, not of subsidence. Again, the
    sea-level is itself inconstant. The extent of its changes cannot now be
    measured, but they have probably been more considerable in the course
    of geological history than has been commonly recognized. It is true
    that they take place slowly, as far as known, but it is also true that
    the duration <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>of an erosion cycle is sufficiently long for even very
    slow changes to reach great magnitude. The sea-level, therefore, can
    hardly be accepted as the absolute base-level, unless (1) the absolute
    base-level is a variable, and unless (2) the absolute base-level be a
    surface below which rivers may cut to the extent of at least 250 feet.</p>

  <p>The ocean may be looked upon as a barrier which in a general way limits
    the down-cutting of running water; for only very large streams cut much
    below its level. Other barriers, such as lakes, and the outcrops of
    hard rock in a stream’s bed, have a comparable, though more temporary,
    effect on the development of valley plains above. Plains thus developed
    have been called <i>temporary base-levels</i>. They differ from other
    graded plains in being controlled primarily by a barrier below, rather
    than by conditions which exist above.</p>

  <p>Since river valleys have a beginning and pass through various stages
    of development before the country they drain is base-leveled, it
    is important to recognize their various stages of advancement. Nor
    is this difficult. An old valley and a young one have different
    characteristics, and the one would no more be mistaken for the other by
    those who have learned to interpret them, than the face of an aged man
    would be mistaken for that of a child.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The cycle begins with the beginning of valley development, and at that
    stage drainage is in its <i>infancy</i>. The type of the infant valley
    is the gully or ravine (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig067">67</a> and <a href="#fig068">68</a>). It has steep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> slopes and a
    narrow bottom. <a href="#plate_IVa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1 of Plate IV</a> represents similar, or rather older,
    ravines in contour (shore of Lake Michigan, just north of Chicago).
    With age, the valley widens, lengthens, and deepens, and passes from
    infancy to <i>youth</i>. In this stage also the valleys are relatively
    narrow, and the divides between them broad. They may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> deep or
    shallow, according to the height of the land in which they are cut, and
    the fall of the water flowing through them; but in any case the streams
    flowing through them have done but a small part of the work they are
    to do before the country they drain is base-leveled. <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig069">69</a> and <a href="#fig070">70</a>,

  <p>Not only are narrow valleys said to be young, but the territory
    affected by them is said to be in its topographic youth, since but
    a small part of the time necessary to reduce it to base-level has
    elapsed. An area is in its topographic youth when considerable portions
    of it are still unaffected by valleys. Thus the areas (as a whole), as
    well as the valleys, represented on <a href="#plate_IV">Plate IV</a>, are in their topographic
    youth. It is often convenient to recognize various sub-stages, such
    as early, middle, and late, within the youthful stage of valleys or
    topographies. The different parts of the areas shown on <a href="#plate_IV">Plate IV</a>, for
    example, represent different stages of youth.</p>

  <p>Youthful streams, as well as youthful topographies, have their
    distinctive characteristics. They are usually swift; their cutting is
    mainly at the bottom rather than at the sides, and their courses are
    often marked by rapids and falls.</p>

  <p>As valleys approach base-level they develop flats. As the valleys and
    their flats widen, and as their tributaries increase in numbers and
    size, a stage of erosion is presently reached where but little of the
    original upland surface remains. The country is largely reduced to
    slopes. In this condition the drainage and the topography which it has
    determined are said to be <i>mature</i>. Mature topography is shown in
    contours in the figures of <a href="#plate_V">Plate V</a>, and in the northern part of <a href="#plate_VI">Plate
    VI</a>, where slopes, rather than upland or valley flats, predominate.
    <a href="#plate_Va"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1 of Plate V</a> represents an area in southeastern Kentucky (<abbr title="Latitude">Lat.</abbr>
    37° 12′, <abbr title="Longitude">Long.</abbr> 83° 10′); <a href="#plate_Vb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2</a>, an area in western Virginia. <a href="#plate_VI">Plate
    VI</a> represents an area in southern California, somewhat west of San
    Bernardino. The three areas are alike in representing mature drainage,
    though not of equal stages of advancement. The striking differences
    of topography of the three areas are the result of differences in
    rock structure and altitude, and will be considered later. Mature
    topography is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> shown in <a href="#fig071"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 71</a>, where the relief is moderate,
    and in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig072">72</a> and <a href="#fig073">73</a>, where it is great. <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig072">72</a> and <a href="#fig073">73</a> illustrate
    clearly the universal tendency of rivers in regions of notable relief
    to develop new flats well below the old surface of the region. At the
    same time that these low-lying flats are developing, tributary drainage
    is dissecting and roughening the upper surfaces. This process is well
    shown in <a href="#fig073"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 73</a>. In both <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig072">72</a> and <a href="#fig073">73</a> the summits of the mountains
    on either side of the valleys appear to have had about the same
    elevation. The new flat is therefore developed at the expense of the
    old flat. As will be seen in the sequel, the first flat which a stream
    develops along its course is usually somewhat above base-level. It is a
    <i>graded</i> flat.</p>

  <p>The same processes which have made young valleys mature will in time
    work further changes. When the gradients of the valleys have become
    low and their bottoms wide, and when the intervening ridges and hills
    have become narrow and small, the drainage and the drainage topography
    have reached <i>old age</i>, and the streams are in a condition of
    senility. This is illustrated by <a href="#plate_VIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, Plate VII</a> (central Kansas),
    and in section by the third and lower lines in <a href="#fig064"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 64</a>. Topographic old
    age sometimes has a different expression; this is shown in <a href="#fig074"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 74</a>,
    where most of the surface has been brought low. The elevations which
    rise above the general plain are small in area, but have abrupt slopes.
    This phase of old-age topography is usually the result of the unequal
    resistance of the rock degraded. The effects of unequal rock-resistance
    will be considered later.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig073">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/fig073.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 73.—Mature erosion in a mountain region.
      Silverton, <abbr title="Colorado">Colo.</abbr> (Cross, <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The marks of old streams are as characteristic as those of young
    ones. They have low gradients and are sluggish. Instead of lowering
    their channels steadily they cut them down in flood, and fill them up
    when their currents are not swollen. They meander widely in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> their
    flat-bottomed valleys (<a href="#plate_VIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> VII</a>, Central Kansas) and their
    erosion, except in time of flood, is largely lateral.</p>

  <p>If the processes of degradation were to continue until the land
    surface was brought to sea-level, and this might be done by solution
    though not by mechanical erosion of running water, the rivers would no
    longer flow, and the drainage system would have reached the end of its
    history—<i>death</i>.</p>

  <p>Not only do valleys normally pass from birth to youth, from youth to
    maturity, and from maturity to old age, but a single river system
    may show these various stages of development in its various parts.
    Thus in the area shown in <a href="#plate_VIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, Plate VII</a> (north central Kansas),
    there is a tract (extreme southwest) where the erosion history is
    scarcely begun. The zone of land a little farther northeast, and just
    reached by the heads of the valleys (same figure), is in its youth.
    The well-drained and uneven tract southwest of the flat of the Solomon
    River is in maturity, while the flat of the main valley has the general
    characteristics of old age.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig074">
    <img class="illowp88" src="images/fig074.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 74.—A peneplained surface where the
      elevations are small but steep-sided. Near Camp Douglas, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr> (Atwood.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The age of valleys in terms of erosion is also expressed more or
    less perfectly by their cross-sections. The line 1–1 (and 1′–1′) of
    <a href="#fig064"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 64</a> represents in cross-section a narrow V-shaped valley. Such a
    section is always indicative of youth. The stream which developed it
    cut chiefly at its bottom, not at its sides. It was therefore rapid,
    and rapid streams are young. The line 2–2, (2′–2′) (<a href="#fig064"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 64</a>) shows
    the same valley at a later and maturer stage when downward cutting
    has nearly ceased. The widening of the valley by slope wash has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
    become relatively more important than before, and the stream has so far
    lost velocity as the result of diminished gradient as to be unable to
    carry away all the detritus washed down from the sides. As a result of
    deposition at the bases of the side slopes, a concave curve has been
    developed. Up the valley from the point where such a section as is
    represented by 2–2 occurs, the valley may still have a section similar
    to that represented by 1–1.</p>

  <p>Still later stages of development are represented by the cross-sections
    3–3 and 4–4. Not only has the valley become larger, but the stream
    has deposited detritus (not shown in the figure) in the bottom of its
    valley, developing an alluvial flat. On this flat the stream meanders,
    and the valley may be widened by the undercutting of the bluffs
    wherever the stream in its wanderings reaches them (<a href="#plate_VIII"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> VIII</a>, near
    St. Louis). A valley might possess the characteristics shown by the
    cross-sections 3–3, 2–2, and 1–1, <a href="#fig064"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 64</a>, in its lower, middle, and
    upper courses, respectively.</p>

  <p>The preceding discussion, and the illustrations which accompany it,
    give some idea of the topography which characterizes an area in various
    stages of its erosion history. Whether the valleys are deep or shallow,
    and the intervening ridges high or low, depends on the original height
    of the land and its distance from the sea. The higher the land, and the
    nearer it is to the sea, the greater the relief developed by erosion. A
    plateau near the sea may become mountainous in the mature stage of its
    erosion history, while a plain in the same situation would only become
    hilly. A plateau in the heart of a continent would have less relief
    in its maturity than one of equal elevation near the sea, since the
    grade-plain in the former position is higher than in the latter. Plates
    <a href="#plate_IV">IV</a> and <a href="#plate_IX">IX</a> show youthful topography where the relief is relatively
    slight, and Plate <a href="#plate_Xa">X</a> shows youthful topography where the relief is
    great. Similarly, Plates <a href="#plate_V">V</a> and <a href="#plate_VI">VI</a> show mature topography where the
    relief is great, and <a href="#plate_IIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, Plate III</a>, shows mature topography where
    the relief is relatively slight.</p>

  <p>Topographic youth, topographic maturity, and topographic old age
    are also indicated in other ways, and especially by the presence of
    features which rivers tend to destroy. If, for example, the surface
    of the land, well above the valley bottoms, is marked by numerous
    ponds and marshes, it is clear that drainage has not yet progressed
    beyond its early stages, for, unless the lakes be very deep, valleys
    working back into the land will find and drain them before topographic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
    maturity has been reached. Their presence is evidence that the region
    where they occur has not yet been thoroughly dissected by erosion
    lines, and therefore has not reached maturity. Still other marks of
    topographic youth, such as rapids, falls, etc., as well as marks of
    topographic maturity and old age, will be mentioned in the following
    pages.</p>

  <h3>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TOPOGRAPHIES DEVELOPED BY RIVER EROSION.</h3>

  <p>With the characteristics of river valleys and the methods by which
    they grow clearly in mind it is easy to say whether rivers have been
    the chief agents in the development of a given topography. River
    valleys are distinguished from other depressions on land surfaces by
    their linear form and, leaving out of consideration the relatively
    insignificant inequalities in a stream’s channel, by the fact that any
    point in the bottom of a river valley is lower than any other point
    farther up the stream in the same valley, and higher than any point
    farther down the stream. The second point might be otherwise stated
    by saying that every valley excavated by erosion leads to a lower
    valley, or to the sea, or an inland basin. Streams which dry up, or
    otherwise disappear as they flow, constitute partial exceptions. If,
    therefore, the depressions on a land surface are linear, lead to other
    and deeper valleys, and finally to an inland basin, or the sea, and
    if the elevations between these valleys are such as might have been
    left by the excavation of the valleys, it is generally clear that
    rain and rivers have been the chief factors in the development of
    the topography. If, on the other hand, a surface is characterized by
    topographic features which streams cannot develop, such as enclosed
    depressions, or hills and ridges whose arrangement is independent of
    drainage lines, other agents besides rain and surface streams have been
    concerned in its development.</p>

  <h3>SPECIAL FEATURES RESULTING FROM SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF EROSION.</h3>

  <p>Many striking topographic and scenic features result from rain and
    river erosion. Some of them depend primarily on the conditions of
    erosion, such as climate, altitude, etc., while others depend largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
    on the structure and resistance of the rock. Between these two classes
    there is no sharp line of demarkation. Illustrations of two types,
    dependent largely but by no means wholly on conditions independent of
    the rock, are cited at this point. Others will be mentioned in other
    connections.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Bad-land topography.—</b>To a type of topography developed in early
    maturity in certain high regions where the rock is but slightly, though
    unequally, resistant, a special name is sometimes given. Such regions
    are termed <i>bad lands</i>. Some idea of bad-land topography is gained
    from <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig075">75</a> to <a href="#fig078">78</a>. Bad-land topography is found in various localities
    in the West, but especially in western Nebraska and Wyoming, and the
    western parts of the Dakotas. The formations here are often beds of
    sandstone or shale, alternating with unindurated beds of clay. Climatic
    factors are also concerned in the development of bad-land topography. A
    semi-arid climate, where the precipitation is much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> concentrated, seems
    to be most favorable for its development. The bad-land topography is
    most striking in early maturity.</p>

      rainfall is unequally distributed. (Darton, <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Special forms of valleys; canyons.—</b>Various conditions influence
    the size and shape of valleys, especially in the early stage of their
    development. If the altitude of the land be great, the gradient of
    the streams at this stage will be high. A high gradient means a
    swift stream, and a swift stream erodes chiefly at its bottom. High
    altitudes therefore favor the development of deep valleys. Such valleys
    will be narrow if the conditions which determine widening are absent
    or unfavorable. Since slope wash is one of the main factors in the
    widening of valleys, an arid climate favors the development of narrow
    valleys, if there be sufficient water to maintain a vigorous stream.
    Narrowness and steepness of slopes will also be favored if the valley
    is cut in rock which is capable of standing with steep faces. Thus
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>a stream may develop a narrow valley in indurated rock where it
    would not do so in loose gravel, and, other things being equal, it
    will develop a narrower valley in rock which is horizontally bedded
    than in rock the beds of which are inclined. Aridity, high altitude,
    and the proper sort of rock structure therefore favor the development
    of canyons, and many of the young valleys in the western part of the
    United States where these conditions prevail, belong to this class.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>While all canyons are valleys, most valleys are not canyons. The
    distinction between a canyon and a valley which is not a canyon is not
    sharp. The canyon depends for its distinctive character on the relation
    of depth, width, and angle of slope to one another; but any definition
    of the depth, width, and angle of slope necessary to constitute a
    valley a canyon is arbitrary.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In popular usage the rule seems to
    be that if a valley is sufficiently deep, narrow, and steep-sided to
    be distinctly striking, it is called a canyon in regions where that
    term is in use. Whether a valley is deep, narrow, and steep-sided
    enough to be striking clearly depends on the observer. The Colorado
    Canyon (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig079">79</a> and <a href="#fig080">80</a>) is the greatest canyon known, but it is rarely
    more than a mile deep, and where its depth approaches this figure it
    is often eight, ten, or even twelve miles wide from rim to rim. Its
    width at bottom is little more than the width of the stream; that is,
    a few hundred feet. Its cross-profile throughout much of its course
    is therefore not in keeping with the conventional idea of a canyon.
    With a depth of one mile and a width of eight, the slope, if uniform,
    would have an angle of less than 15°. Such a valley is represented in
    <a href="#fig081"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 81</a>. As a matter of fact the slopes of a canyon are not commonly
    uniform. The slopes represented in <a href="#fig082"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 82</a> correspond more nearly than
    those of <a href="#fig081"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 81</a>, to the actual slopes of the Colorado Canyon. The
    inequalities of slope are occasioned by the inequalities of hardness.
    It is perhaps needless to say that to an observer on the rim of the
    canyon the slopes seem several times as steep as those shown in the
    diagrams.</p>

  <p>Like all valleys which are narrow relative to their depth, the Colorado
    Canyon, great as it is, is a young valley; for it represents but a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>small part of the work which the stream must do to bring its drainage
    basin to base-level.</p>

  <p>While aridity and altitude are conditions which favor the development
    of canyons, as shown by the fact that most canyons are high and dry
    regions, they are not indispensable. Niagara River has a canyon below
    its falls (<a href="#plate_IX"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> IX</a>), and the surrounding region is neither high nor
    arid. The narrow part of the valley has been developed by the recession
    of the falls, and is so young that side erosion has not yet widened the
    valley or lowered its angle of slope to such an extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> as to destroy
    its canyon character. This canyon is often called a <i>gorge</i>, a
    term frequently applied to small valleys of the canyon type.</p>

  <h3>THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE AMONG VALLEYS AND STREAMS.</h3>

  <p>It is not to be inferred that every gully becomes a valley, nor that
    every small valley becomes a large one. Among valleys, as among living
    things, there is a struggle for existence, and fitness determines
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>growth and survival. At an early stage of its erosion history the
    number of small valleys in a given area is often great, while at a
    later stage the number is less and the size of the survivors greater.</p>

      successive cross-sections.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>One phase of the struggle for existence is often well illustrated
    on a freshly exposed slope of clay. The number of miniature gullies
    which develop on such a slope, even in a single shower, may be very
    large (<a href="#fig084"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 84</a>); but the history of many of them is ephemeral. If two
    adjacent ones are of unequal depth the widening of the deeper narrows
    and finally eliminates the divide between them, and the two become one
    (<a href="#fig085"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 85</a>).</p>

  <p>Another phase of the struggle for existence is shown in other
    situations. Examination of a good map of the north shore of Lake
    Superior or the west shore of Lake Michigan shows a large number of
    small streams and gullies (<a href="#plate_IVa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> IV</a>). The valleys are short and
    narrow, and between and beyond them are considerable areas untouched by
    erosion. The drainage near the lake is therefore young, and each of the
    small valleys is growing. This condition of things is perhaps typical
    of that which has been, is, or will be along the average coast at a
    certain stage in its erosion history. No equal stretch of coast-line
    where erosion is far advanced can boast of a number of large rivers
    comparable to that of the many small ones along the coasts mentioned.
    It therefore seems evident that of these many small streams a few only
    will attain considerable size.</p>

  <p>Some of the methods by which the growth of the many is arrested
    are easily understood. Some of the young valleys on a given coast
    will work their heads back into the land faster than others because
    of inequalities of slope and material. This will be true of the
    tributaries no less than of their mains. If valleys develop in
    ways other than by head erosion (see <a href="#Page_73"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 73</a>) the chances are also
    against their equality of growth. If two streams, such as <i>a</i>
    and <i>c</i>, <a href="#fig086"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 86</a>, develop faster than the intermediate stream
    <i>b</i>, it is clear that their tributaries may work back into the
    territory which at the outset drained into <i>b</i>, so as to cut off
    the supply of water from the latter stream (compare <i>a′b′c′</i>,
    <a href="#fig086"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 87</a>). As a result, the growth of <i>b</i> will be checked, and
    ultimately stopped. Similarly other valleys, such as <i>f</i>, will
    get the better of their neighbors, and many of the competitors, as
    <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>g</i> will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> soon drop out of
    the race. Between the stronger streams competition still goes on. If
    <i>a′</i> and <i>f′</i> develop faster than <i>c′</i> its prospective
    drainage territory will be preëmpted by its rivals (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig086">87</a>
    and <a href="#fig086">88</a>). Thus as the result of the unequal rate at which valleys are
    lengthened, the larger number of those which come into existence are
    arrested in their development. As a result of growth in the manner
    indicated, the basins of even the large streams remain narrow at
    their lower ends while they expand above. This is the usual form of a
    drainage basin the development of which has been normal.</p>

      stages in the struggle for existence and dominion among streams.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

  <p>Did valleys grow in length only, competition would not destroy the
    small ones; it would simply limit them. But valleys widen as well as
    lengthen, and by widening, adjacent valleys may eliminate the divide
    between them and become one. The elimination of the intervening ridge
    may be by lateral planation (<a href="#Page_82"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 82</a>), or, if the valleys be of unequal
    depth, by slope wash (see <a href="#fig085"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 85</a>). By these and other processes many
    young valleys are dwarfed, and many others are destroyed.</p>

  <p><b>Piracy.—</b>Streams do not always hold the courses which they
    establish for themselves at the outset. If the valley occupied by the
    stream <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig089"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 89</a>, is deepened more rapidly than the valley
    occupied by <i>b</i>, a tributary from the former, <i>c</i>, may work
    back across the inter-stream area to e and steal the head waters
    of that stream (<a href="#fig089"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 90</a>). The tributary which does the stealing is
    known as a <i>pirate</i>. Stream <i>f</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> (<a href="#fig089"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 90</a>) is said to be
    <i>beheaded</i>, and its upper portion, <i>de</i>, diverted. The
    beheaded stream is diminished in volume; or if its total supply of
    water came in above the point of tapping it would disappear altogether.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig089">

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 89 and 90.—Diagrams to illustrate piracy.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The process may not end even here. If after the diversion of <i>de</i>
    the point in the channel to the left is lowered faster than the channel
    of the beheaded stream <i>f</i>, the divide between <i>dg</i> and the
    head of <i>f</i> (<a href="#fig089"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 90</a>) will be shifted down the valley of the
    latter, as shown in <a href="#fig091"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 91</a>. The shifting will go on until the divide
    reaches a position of stability, that is, until erosion on its opposite
    sides is equal.</p>

    <img class="illowp70" src="images/fig091.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 91.—Diagram showing the shifting of a
      divide after piracy.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The foregoing case may be called <i>foreign piracy</i> because the
    valleys of different systems are concerned. <i>Domestic piracy</i> may
    also take place, as illustrated in the accompanying diagrams (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig092">92</a>
    and <a href="#fig092">93</a>). Here a tributary to a crooked river may develop, working back
    until it taps the main at a higher point, thus straightening the course
    of the stream. The change takes place only when the highest point in
    the tributary valley is brought below the surface of the water in the
    main stream at the point where the tapping takes place. This would be
    likely to occur only after the main stream had attained a low gradient,
    for so long as it is deepening its channel notably, the small amount of
    water flowing through the tributary valley would not be likely to bring
    it down to the level of the main. In any case the flow of water from
    the main stream through the new valley would be likely to be started
    during flood, and at such time the erosion in the new channel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> would be
    great. The complete and final diversion of the stream through the new
    channel might be a slow process.</p>

      tributary, <i>a</i> of <abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 92, develops headward until it taps the
      main stream at <i>b</i>, giving the result shown in <abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 93.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Piracy may occur where the material in which the valleys are cut is
    homogeneous; but, as will be seen later, heterogeneity of material,
    by determining unequal rates of erosion, stimulates the piratical
    proclivities of streams.</p>

  <p>An actual case of piracy is shown on <a href="#plate_XI">Plate XI</a>. North and South Lakes
    formerly drained westward to the Schoharie Creek, the present head
    of which is in the extreme northwest corner of the map. The head of
    Kaaterskill Creek, which had a much higher gradient, worked back
    and captured the head of the westward-flowing stream, diverting the
    drainage from North and South Lakes to itself. Schoharie Creek was thus
    beheaded.</p>

  <p>Plaatekill Creek, near the south limit of the map, appears to have
    beheaded the creek flowing west and northwest, similarly diverting its
    head waters. The Dells, <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>, quadrangle (<abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>) affords an
    illustration of domestic piracy.</p>

  <h3>RATE OF DEGRADATION.</h3>

  <p>The amount of mechanical sediment which the Mississippi River carries
    to the Gulf of Mexico is estimated to represent a rate of degradation
    for the Mississippi basin of about one foot in 5000 years. But the
    mechanical sediment carried to the Gulf does not really represent the
    total degradation of the basin, for the water which sinks beneath the
    surface is dissolving more or less rock substance, especially lime
    carbonate. This material is carried to the sea in solution, and does
    not appear in the sediment on which the above estimate is based. Taking
    into account the matter dissolved by the water and carried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> the sea
    in solution, the average rate of degradation for the Mississippi basin
    is estimated at one foot in 3000 to 4000 years.</p>

  <p>It is not to be inferred that this rate is uniform, or even that
    erosion at any rate whatsoever is taking place in all parts of the
    basin. Such is not the fact. On the whole the rate of erosion is
    doubtless greatest toward the margins of the basins where the land
    is in its topographic youth or early maturity. It is notably less in
    the middle courses of the valleys, and erosion is locally exceeded by
    deposition along the lower courses of the Mississippi and some of its
    main tributaries.</p>

  <p>The average elevation of North America is not accurately known, but it
    is probably not far from 2000 feet. If the present rate of degradation,
    say one foot in 3500 years, were to continue, it would take something
    like 7,000,000 years to bring the continent to sea-level. But this rate
    of degradation could not continue to the end, for as the continent
    became lower streams would become sluggish and erosion less rapid.
    Long before the continent reached base-level the rate of degradation,
    so far as dependent on mechanical erosion, would become so slow that
    the time necessary to bring the continent to sea-level would be almost
    inconceivably prolonged. Furthermore, it is quite possible that
    the land is suffering, or is liable to suffer, uplift, relative or
    absolute. If the rate of rise were equal to the rate of degradation the
    average height of the continent would of course not be affected.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The amount of sediment carried by streams in suspension varies
      notably according to the stage of the water. During a year when
      the stream was under careful study the Mississippi at Carrollton
      (<abbr title="Mississippi">Miss.</abbr>) was found to carry ¹⁄₆₈₁ of its weight of sediment during
      the high-water stage of June, and ¹⁄₆₃₈₃ during the low-water of
      October, the average for the year being ¹⁄₁₈₀₈. The average of a
      greater number of records gives about ¹⁄₁₅₀₀ as the average ratio
      between the weight of the sediment and the weight of the water.
      This corresponds to about ¹⁄₂₉₀₀ by volume, the average specific
      gravity being about 1.9. The amount of material carried in the
      upper part of the water was notably less than that carried at
      greater depths, but that carried midway between top and bottom was
      about the same as that carried at the bottom.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

    <p>The discharge of the Mississippi River is about 19,500,000,000,000
      cubic feet of water per year, and the sediment it carries in
      suspension is estimated to weigh about 812,500,000,000 pounds. This
      is equivalent to about 6,714,694,400 cubic feet. It is estimated
      that about 750,000,000 cubic feet of sediment is rolled along the
      bottom, giving a total of 7,468,694,400 cubic feet as the aggregate
      annual load carried to the Gulf by the river. This would be
      adequate to cover an area one square mile in extent to the depth of
      268 feet per year.</p>

  <p>Murray also estimates that the aggregate amount of water flowing
    into the sea annually is about 6528 cubic miles, which, on the
    above basis, would carry about 4,975,000,000 tons of mineral matter
    in solution.</p>

  <p>A large number of analyses of waters of rivers from the United
    States and Canada give an average of about .15,044 part in a
    thousand of mineral matter in solution, more than one-third being
    CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The average amount of mineral matter in solution in 48
    European streams cited by Bischoff<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is .2127 part in a thousand,
    of which CaCO<sub>3</sub> is rather more than half. The average mineral
    matter in solution in 36 rivers cited by Roth<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> (including some
    of those tabulated by Bischoff) is .2033 part in a thousand, of
    which CaCO<sub>3</sub> is slightly less than one-half.</p>

  <p>An average for American and European rivers, so far as determinable
    from data at hand, is about .1888 part in a thousand in solution,
    of which CaCO<sub>3</sub> is slightly less than one-half. These last
    figures are probably not very far from an average for river water
    in general.</p>

    erosion are worthy of note. When a drainage system has reached its
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>mature stage its basin has the roughest topography which it will have
    at any time during that cycle of erosion. At that stage, therefore,
    road construction is relatively difficult. If the relief be great,
    roads must follow the valleys, or the crests of the ridges between
    them, if they would avoid heavy grades. In such regions roads are
    usually few and crooked.</p>

  <p>The stage of development of valleys has an influence on the
    navigability of their streams. Streams well advanced in life are much
    more readily navigable than young ones, because their grades are lower
    and their volumes of water greater. Old streams, on the other hand, are
    sometimes depositing sand or silt along their lower courses to such an
    extent as to interfere with navigation.</p>

  <p>At certain stages of their development the power of streams is more
    easily utilized than at others. Young streams, depending as they do for
    their supply on the rainfall of a limited area, are likely to be fitful
    in their flow, and therefore unreliable as a source of power. This is
    especially true where the precipitation is unequally distributed, and
    where the slopes are steep and free from forests. Because of their
    great volume, old and large streams, though sluggish, have great power,
    but it is less easily controlled. Where streams are large enough to be
    navigable industrial considerations often prevent the utilization of
    their power, the streams being more serviceable as highways than as
    sources of power. Other things being equal, it follows that streams are
    most available for water-power when they are large enough to have a
    moderately steady flow, and not so large as to be beyond ready control,
    or to be valuable for purposes of navigation.</p>

  <p>Streams are subject to more disastrous floods in some stages of their
    development than in others. Floods resulting from heavy rains are
    likely to be greatest where the slopes above the drainage lines are on
    the whole greatest, for this is the condition under which the water is
    most quickly gathered into the drainage channels. The most disastrous
    floods, humanly speaking, are those which affect wide-bottomed valleys,
    where the flats are settled. In such cases a relatively slight rise
    may flood very extensive areas. In such valleys the most disastrous
    floods are generally in the spring, when the waters from the melting
    snows of the preceding winter are being discharged.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Many other
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>considerations enter into the problem of floods. The presence of
    forests and other forms of vegetation on the slopes retards the flow of
    water into the valleys, and so tends to prevent floods, or at any rate
    to make them less severe. Porous soil and subsoil, or in their absence
    porous rock, absorb the rainfall, and prevent its prompt descent into
    the valleys and so tends to prevent or diminish floods.</p>

  <p>The acreage of arable land within a given area stands in some relation
    to its drainage development. At an early stage in its erosion history,
    before an upland has been dissected by valleys, nearly all of it may
    be arable. Later, when drainage is at its maturity, and when hillsides
    and ridge slopes constitute a large part of the area, there is probably
    the least acreage of arable land. This is especially true if the slopes
    are so steep as to allow the soil to be readily washed away. At a still
    later stage, when the valley bottoms have become wide and the slopes
    of the ridges and hills so reduced as to be available, the area of
    cultivable land is again increased.</p>

  <p>Marshes, ponds, and lakes have some bearing on the resources and
    industries of a region, and they stand in a more or less definite
    relation to the stage of erosion in which a region finds itself. In its
    youth ponds and lakes may occupy much of the surface; in its maturity
    they will have been largely drained.</p>

  <p>These suggestions are sufficient to show that the topography of a
    region, even in so far as shaped by erosion, touches human interests at
    many points.</p>

  <h3>ANALYSIS OF EROSION.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></h3>

  <p>Erosion is the term applied to all the processes by which earthy
    matter or rock is loosened and removed from one place to another.
    It consists of three sub-processes, namely, <i>weathering</i>,
    <i>transportation</i>, and <i>corrasion</i>.</p>

  <h4><i>Weathering.</i></h4>

  <p>The term weathering is applied to nearly all those natural processes
    which tend to loosen or change the exposed surfaces of rock. The
    lettering of inscriptions on exposed marble becomes fainter and fainter
    as time goes by, and finally disappears, because the rock in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>which
    the letters were cut has weathered away. Some of it has crumbled off
    as the result of the expansion and contraction induced by changes of
    temperature, and some of it has been dissolved by the rain which has
    fallen upon it. In this case the weathering is effected partly by the
    atmosphere and partly by water. These are the chief, but not the only
    agents concerned in the general processes of weathering. Those phases
    of weathering which are the result of the activities of the atmosphere,
    whether physical or chemical, have been discussed in connection with
    the atmosphere (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_42">42</a> and <a href="#Page_54">54</a>).</p>

  <p>The rain which falls upon the surface of exposed rock, and that which
    sinks through the soil to the solid rock below, dissolves, even if
    slowly, some of the rock constituents. Each constituent of a rock
    composed of several minerals may be looked upon as a binding material
    for the others. When one is dissolved the rock crumbles, much as mortar
    does when the lime which cements the sand is dissolved.</p>

  <p>The solution of mineral matter by ground water, as well as the
    other chemical changes it effects, is greatly augmented by the
    impurities, especially carbonic and other organic gases, dissolved by
    the water from the atmosphere and the soil. The commonest chemical
    changes effected by the joint action of water and air, oxidation
    and carbonation, have been referred to in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>. Hydration is
    more exclusively the work of water, and is one of the commonest
    processes of rock change, and often of rock disintegration. Numerous
    other less simple chemical changes resulting from the activities
    of ground water are constantly in progress, and in so far as they
    lead to the disintegration of rock are processes of weathering. Many
    chemical changes involve notable changes in volume of the mineral
    matter concerned. Merrill has calculated that in the conversion of
    the granitic rock of the vicinity of Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">D.&nbsp;C.</abbr>, into soil,
    its volume has been increased 88 percent., largely as the result
    of hydration.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Even when the chemical changes do not themselves
    directly involve the disintegration of the rock, the accompanying
    increase of volume is sometimes sufficient to cause its physical
    disruption. This also may be regarded as a phase of weathering.</p>

  <p>The weathering accomplished by water, or under its influence, proceeds
    at rates which vary with the composition of the rock, the amount and
    composition of the water, the temperature, and certain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>other factors
    less susceptible of brief statement. The weathering effected by ground
    water has a wider range both in area and depth than that due to
    changes of temperature, for while the latter is effective only where
    temperature changes are considerable, and where coherent material lies
    at the surface (<a href="#Page_45"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 45</a>), the former is operative to all depths to which
    water sinks.</p>

      a steep bluff. Weber Canyon, Uinta Mountains, Utah. The talus has
      accumulated since the last glaciation of the valley and is therefore of
      very recent origin. (Church.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>There are other processes of weathering not due directly either to
    the atmosphere or to water. The roots of trees and smaller plants
    frequently grow into cracks of rocks, and, increasing in size, act much
    like freezing water (<a href="#Page_45"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 45</a>) in similar situations. This wedge-work of
    roots is a phase of weathering.</p>

  <p>From the faces of steep cliffs masses of rock frequently fall. However
    dislodged, their descent is effected by gravity. The quantities of
    débris at the bases of many cliffs, forming slopes of <i>talus</i>
    (<a href="#fig094"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 94</a>), testify to the importance of the action of gravity in
    getting material from higher to lower levels. Another phase of
    gravity-work is shown in <a href="#fig095"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 95</a>. Here, under the influence of gravity
    and expansion and contraction, due to freezing and thawing and wetting
    and drying, the surface material is creeping down slope. In the process
    the rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> is being broken. The process illustrated by the figure
    involves weathering as well as other factors.</p>

  <p>The foregoing are among the commoner processes of weathering, although
    they do not exhaust the list. The more active and tangible processes
    by which surface rocks are broken up, such as wave wear, river wear
    and glacier wear, are processes of corrasion. The mechanical wear
    effected by wind-driven sand might be considered either as corrasion
    or as weathering. It is more likely to be regarded as corrasion if the
    amount of wear is considerable enough to be obvious. Rock is sometimes
    decomposed by the chemical action of hot vapors, gases, and waters
    rising to the surface from considerable depths. This is often seen in
    volcanic regions. A conspicuous illustration is seen in the canyon of
    the Yellowstone in the National Park. Decay of this sort is perhaps not
    properly weathering, but is not always readily distinguished from it.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig095">
    <img class="illowp92" src="images/fig095.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 95.—Shows the downward creep of soil and
      slaty rock under the influence of gravity.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The importance of weathering in the general processes of erosion is
    shown in many ways. In regions where the mantle rock is the product
    of the decay of the solid rock beneath, and such regions constitute a
    large portion of the earth’s surface, the soil and subsoil represent
    the excess of weathering over transportation. Since most of the earth’s
    surface is covered with soil to a greater or less depth, it is clear
    that, on the whole, weathering keeps ahead of transportation. Again,
    it is clear that the loosening of rock by weathering greatly increases
    the erosion which a given amount of moving water can accomplish.
    Not only this, but weathering plays a much more important rôle in
    the development of valleys than is commonly realized. This is best
    illustrated by the valleys of young swift streams. The valley which
    is not at its top ten times as wide as its stream is rare. The stream
    which has such a canyon has been cutting chiefly at its bottom.
    Ignoring its lateral corrasion, which is slight, the valley which it
    would cut would have a width equal to its own. This is illustrated by
    <a href="#fig096"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 96</a>. Weathering in its broadest sense is largely responsible for
    the width of such a valley, in so far as it exceeds the width of the
    stream. The work of weathering, slope wash, etc., has been to get the
    material which originally lay between <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>
    down to the stream. The stream has then carried it away. The above
    illustration would not apply to old and sluggish streams, for they, by
    their meandering, widen their valleys independently of weathering.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 96.—Diagram of a valley the top of which
      is ten times the width of the stream.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Weathering is a part of erosion, but only a part. In so far as it is
    effected by solution the process involves the transportation of that
    which is dissolved to some other point. Transportation is also involved
    to some extent in the other processes of weathering, but the central
    idea of the processes embraced under this term is the loosening and
    disrupting of rock by which it is prepared for transportation.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

  <h4><i>Transportation.</i></h4>

  <p>The second element of erosion is transportation. The transportation
    of mechanical sediment is to be distinguished from the transportation
    of materials in solution. In so far as mineral matter is dissolved
    it becomes, so far as flowage is concerned, a part of the stream. If
    the quantity dissolved were large it might influence the mobility of
    the water, but the amount is usually too slight to influence the flow
    sensibly.</p>

  <p>The sediment transported by a stream is either rolled along its bottom
    or carried in suspension at some higher level. The coarser materials
    (gravel and sand) are carried chiefly in the former position, and the
    finer (silt and mud) largely in the latter.</p>

  <p><b>Transporting power and velocity.—</b>The transporting power of
    running water depends on its velocity. The formula expressing the
    relations between them is as follows: Transporting power, <i>t</i>,
    varies as the sixth power of velocity, <i>v</i>, (<i>tαv<sup>6</sup></i>); that
    is, doubling the velocity of the stream increases its transporting
    power 64-fold. Strictly speaking, this means that if a stream of
    given velocity is just able to move a stone of a given size, a stream
    with double that velocity will be just able to move a stone of the
    same shape 64 times as large as the first. This may be graphically
    illustrated as follows: Let a current be supposed just able to move the
    cube <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig097"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 97</a>). If the current be doubled, twice as much water
    will strike the same surface with twice the force in the same time;
    that is, the force exerted on the cube <i>a</i> will be quadrupled. It
    will, therefore, be able not only to move the one cube, but it will
    be able to move three other cubes (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>)
    besides (<a href="#fig097"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 98</a>). The same current against any other equal surface
    would also be able to move four small cubes, and there are sixteen
    such surfaces on the face of the large cube (<a href="#fig097"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 99</a>). It follows that
    the dimension of the cube which the stream with the doubled velocity
    can move is four times as great as that of the cube which the original
    current could move, and the cubical contents of such a cube is 64 times
    as great as that of the first (64 = 2<sup>6</sup>) (<a href="#fig097"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 99</a>). Swift streams,
    therefore, have enormously greater power of transportation than
    sluggish ones. It does not necessarily follow that transportation keeps
    pace with transporting power; that depends on the accessibility of
    materials suitable for transportation. A stream of great transporting
    power, like the Niagara at its rapids, may carry little sediment,
    because there is little to be had.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

  <p>The velocity of a stream depends chiefly on three elements—its
    gradient, its volume, and its load, (i.e., the sediment it is moving).
    The higher the gradient the greater the volume, and the less the load
    the greater the velocity. The relation between gradient and velocity
    is evident; that between volume and velocity is illustrated by every
    stream in time of flood, when its rate of flow is greatly increased.
    The relation between velocity and load is less obvious, but none the
    less definite. Every particle of sediment carried by a stream makes
    a draught on its energy, and energy expended in this way reduces the
    velocity. The draught on a stream’s energy of a particle carried in
    suspension is measured by its mass into the distance it would fall in a
    unit of time in still water. It follows that a large particle makes a
    stronger draught on a stream’s energy than the same amount of material
    in smaller pieces. It follows also that the comminution of sediment
    facilitates transportation in much more than a simple ratio, for not
    only can a given amount of energy carry more fine material than coarse,
    but a larger proportion of a stream’s energy can be utilized in the
    transportation of the fine.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 97–99.—Diagrammatic representation of the
      effect of increased velocity on transporting power.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>How sediment is carried.—</b>Coarse materials, such as gravel
    stones, are rolled along the bottoms of the swift streams which carry
    them. Their movement is effected by the impact of water. The same is
    true to a large extent of sand grains, especially if they be coarse. So
    far as concerns the material rolled along the bottom it is to be noted
    that a stream’s transporting power is dependent on the velocity of the
    water at its bottom. This is much less than the surface, or even the
    average velocity. The particles of fine sediments, such as silt and
    mud, are frequently carried by streams quite above their bottoms, as
    shown by the roiliness of many streams. A particle of mud is usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
    a small bit of mineral matter, the specific gravity of which is two or
    three times that of water. Why does it not sink through the water and
    come to rest at the bottom of the stream, or suffer transportation as
    the gravel does?</p>

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 100.—Diagram to illustrate the relative
      strength of the two forces acting on a particle in suspension. The
      arrows represent the relative strength of the two forces when the
      stream’s velocity is 5 miles per hour. No account is taken in the
      diagram of the viscosity of the water, or of the acceleration of
      velocity of fall.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A particle of sediment in running water is obviously subject to two
    forces, that of the current which tends to move it nearly horizontally
    down-stream, and that of gravity which tends to carry it to the bed of
    the stream. In <a href="#fig100"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 100</a>, the arrows <i>ab</i> and <i>ac</i> represent
    respectively the relative force of gravity and a current of 5 miles
    per hour. As a result of these two forces the particle would tend to
    descend in the general direction of <i>ad</i>, a line which represents
    the resultant of these forces, though not the exact path which a
    particle acted on by them would take in water. If a river were the
    simple straightforward current which it is popularly thought to be,
    a particle in suspension would reach its bottom in the time it would
    take to sink through an equal depth of still water, for the descent
    would be none the less certain and none the less prompt because of the
    forward movement of the water. The current would simply be a factor in
    determining the position of the particle when it reached the bottom,
    not the time of reaching it. Very fine particles, like those of clay,
    though having the same specific gravity as grains of sand, would sink
    less readily than coarser ones, because they expose larger surfaces,
    relative to their mass, to the water through which they sink. But even
    such particles, unless of extraordinary fineness, would presently reach
    the bottom if acted on only by a horizontal current and gravity. Since
    even sediment which is not of exceeding fineness is kept in suspension
    it is clear that some other factor is involved. This is found, in part
    at least, in the subordinate upward currents in a stream.</p>

  <p>Where a bowlder occurs in the bed of a stream (<a href="#fig101"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 101</a>) the water
    which strikes it is in part forced up over it. If there be many
    bowlders the process is frequently repeated, and the number of upward
    currents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> is great. Any roughness will serve the same purpose, and
    every stream’s bed is rough to a greater or less extent. Where there
    are roughnesses at the sides of a channel, currents are started which
    flow from them toward the center. The varying velocities of the
    different parts of a stream serve a similar purpose. The curves in a
    river tend to give the water a rotatory movement. A river is therefore
    to be looked upon not as a single straightforward current, but as a
    multitude of currents, some rising from the bottom toward the top, some
    descending from top to bottom, some diverging from the center toward
    the sides, and some converging from the sides toward the center. The
    existence of these subordinate currents is often evident from the
    boiling and eddying readily seen in many streams. It is, of course,
    true that the sum of the upward currents is always less than the sum of
    the downward, so that the aggregate motion of the water is down slope;
    but it is also true that minor upward currents are common. Sediment
    in suspension is held up chiefly by such currents, which, locally
    and temporarily, overcome the effect of gravity. The particles in
    suspension are constantly tending to fall, and frequently falling; but
    before they reach the bottom many of them are seized and carried upward
    by the subordinate currents, only to sink and be carried up again. Even
    if they reach the bottom, as they frequently do, they may be picked
    up again. It is probable that every particle of sediment of such size
    that it would sink readily in still water is dropped and picked up many
    times in the course of any long river journey, and its periods of rest
    often exceed its periods of movement.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 101.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of
      bowlders, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, in a stream’s bed on the currents of
      water impinging against them.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Independently of the subordinate currents, the different velocities of
    the different parts of a stream tend to keep materials in suspension
    by exerting different pressures on the different sides of suspended
    particles.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

  <p>River ice sometimes facilitates the transportation of débris which the
    water alone could not carry. The ice freezes to bowlders in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>banks
    of the streams, to those which are partially submerged, and sometimes
    to those altogether submerged beneath slight depths of water. When the
    ice breaks up in the spring such bowlders, buoyed up by the ice, may be
    floated far down the stream. The influence of ice in this connection is
    most considerable in high latitudes, but it is of consequence as far
    south as Virginia, where the river deposits sometimes contain bowlders
    which the unaided streams could not have carried. <i>Ground ice</i>
    sometimes forms about bowlders in the bottoms of streams, especially
    in the quiet pools of turbulent rivers, and floats them to the surface
    before the surface itself is frozen.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In the floods of spring rivers
    often spread their ice widely over their flood-plains. It is sometimes
    massed in constricted portions of valleys so as to form great dams, the
    breaking of which is attended with great destruction.</p>

  <h4><i>Corrasion.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Abrasion.—</b>The wear effected by running water is
    <i>corrasion</i>. So long as the materials to be carried away are
    incoherent it is easy to see how running water picks them up and
    carries them forward. The water which gathers in the depressions on the
    slope of a cultivated field gathers earthy matter from the surface over
    which it passes, even before it is concentrated into rills, and the
    rills continue the process. Thus the loose materials of the surface are
    gathered at the very sources of the streams, and the amount of sediment
    in the water after a heavy shower, even at the head of the stream, may
    be great. The run-off from the slopes of any valley in any part of its
    course likewise brings sediment to the stream, which gathers more from
    its bed whereever it flows with sufficient velocity over incoherent
    material. Streams also undercut their banks, and receive new load from
    the fall of the overhanging material.</p>

  <p>By far the larger part of the sediment acquired by a normal stream is
    made up of material loosened in advance by the processes of weathering.
    The stream, or the waters which get together to make the stream,
    find them ready-made; but rivers frequently wear rock which is not
    weathered, for the principal valleys of the earth’s surface are cut in
    solid rock, and many of them in rock of exceeding hardness. How does
    the stream wear the solid rock?</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

  <p>When a stream flows over a rock bed, the wear which it accomplishes
    depends chiefly on the character of the rock, the velocity of the
    stream, and the load it carries. If the rock be stratified and in thin
    layers, and if these thin layers be broken by numerous joints at high
    angles to the stratification planes, the impact of the water of a clear
    stream of even moderate strength may be effective in dislodging bits of
    the rock. This condition of things is often seen where streams run on
    beds of shale or slate. If the rock be hard and without bedding-planes
    and joints, or if its layers be thick and its joints few, clear water
    will be much less effective. If the surface of the rock be rough, the
    mechanical action of a swift stream of clear water might still produce
    some effect on it; but if massive hard rock presents a smooth surface
    to a clear stream, the mechanical effect of even a swift current is
    slight.</p>

  <p>This general principle is illustrated by the Niagara River. Just above
    the falls the current is swift. When the river is essentially free from
    sediment, the surface of the limestone near the bank beneath it is
    sometimes distinctly green from the presence of the one-celled plants
    (fresh-water algæ) which grow upon it. The whole force of the mighty
    torrent is not able to sweep them from their moorings. Were the stream
    supplied with a tithe of the sand which it is capable of carrying, it
    would not take many hours, and perhaps not many minutes, to remove the
    last trace of vegetation. This illustration furnishes a clue to the
    method by which the erosion of solid rock in a stream’s bed is effected.</p>

  <p>It has been seen that the ingathering waters which make a stream often
    have abundant sediment before they reach well-defined stream channels,
    and that the streams continue to gather sediment whereever their beds
    are composed of material which is readily detached. The sediments which
    the stream carries are the tools with which it works. Without them
    it is relatively impotent, so far as the abrasion of solid rock is
    concerned; with them, it may wear any rock over which it passes (<a href="#fig102"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    102</a>).</p>

  <p>We have next to inquire the methods by which running water uses its
    tools in the excavation of valleys. When gravel is rolled along in
    the channel of a stream there is friction between it and the bed over
    which it moves. If the pebbles be as hard as the bed over which they
    are rolled their movement must result in its wear, and even if they be
    softer more or less wear takes place. As the moving stones wear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
    rock of the stream’s bed they are themselves worn by impact with it and
    with one another. In all cases the softer material suffers the more
    rapid wear. The first effect of wear on materials in transportation is
    the reduction of their rugosities of surface. The projecting points
    and sharp angles are worn off, and the stones are reduced to rounded
    <i>water-worn</i> forms. The particles broken off make grains of sand,
    or, if very fine, particles of silt or mud. Even after a stone has been
    rounded it is subject to further wear and reduction, and in the course
    of time may be literally worn out.</p>

  <p>The sediment carried in suspension, as well as that rolled along
    the bottom, may wear the rock bed of a stream. When a grain of sand
    in suspension escapes from an upward moving current it may not sink
    quietly. If it be caught by a downward current it may be made to strike
    a blow on the bed of the stream, and the effect of the blow is to wear
    the surface which receives it. The larger the grain and the stronger
    the current the greater the wear.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig102">

      works. The cobbles and bowlders have been shifted by the stream in its

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

  <p>The ceaseless repetition of the blows struck by the material in
    suspension, or rolled on its bottom, hour after hour, day after day,
    and year after year, will accomplish sensible results. In the long
    course of the ages this process has excavated deep valleys. Concomitant
    processes are largely concerned in making valleys wide, but the depth
    of valleys cut in solid rock is chiefly the result of the impact and
    friction of the sediment in transportation.</p>

  <p>The wear effected in this way is not proportional to the number of
    blows struck. Since every pebble and every grain of sand carried
    diminishes the velocity of a stream, and since with diminished velocity
    the force of the blows struck is diminished, it follows that the blows
    may become so weak, as the result of their multiplication, as to be
    ineffective. The larger the load, therefore, which the stream carries,
    the more the tools with which it has to work, but the less effectively
    can it use them; and the load may be so far increased as to destroy its
    corrasive power altogether. On the other hand, the smaller the load
    of the stream the greater its velocity and the more effectively will
    its tools be used; but their number may be so far reduced that their
    aggregate effect is slight. To accomplish the greatest results on a bed
    of solid rock a stream must have tools to work with, but must not be so
    heavily burdened as to interfere with its effective use of them.</p>

  <p>Whatever the cause of their unequal velocities swift and slow streams
    corrade their valleys differently. The erosion of a swift stream is
    chiefly at the bottom of its channel. The sluggish stream lowers
    its channel less rapidly, while lateral erosion is relatively more
    important. The result is that slow streams increase the width of their
    valleys more than the depth, while swift streams increase the depth
    more than the width. It follows that slow streams develop flats, while
    swift ones do not. Not only is a slow stream more likely to have a
    flat, and therefore a better chance to meander, but it is more likely
    to take advantage of opportunities in this line, for a slow stream gets
    out of the way for such obstacles as it may encounter, while a swift
    stream is much more likely to get obstacles out of its way.</p>

  <p>Special phases of corrasion are introduced where waterfalls and other
    peculiarities dependent on inequalities of rock resistance occur.</p>

  <p><b>Solution.—</b>In most cases the solution effected by a stream is
    much less important than its mechanical work. Only when conditions
    are unfavorable to the latter, is solution the chief factor in the
    excavation of a valley. This may be the case where a stream’s bed is
    over soluble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> rock, such as limestone, and where the stream is clear,
    or its gradient so low that its current is sluggish. The solvent power
    of water is not influenced by the presence of sediment, though the
    presence of sediment offers the water a greater surface on which to
    work.</p>

  <h3>CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE RATE OF EROSION.</h3>

  <p>In considering the rate of erosion, both the work of the stream in
    its valley and that of the general run-off are to be considered. The
    conditions which favor the most rapid erosion in a stream’s channel are
    not necessarily those which determine most rapid degradation in the
    basin outside of the valley.</p>

  <h4><i>The Influence of Declivity.</i></h4>

  <p>In general the greater the declivity the more rapid the rate of
    erosion, whether in the stream’s channel or on the slopes above it. The
    truth of this conclusion is illustrated by the great erosive power of
    swift streams as compared with slow ones.</p>

  <p>It does not follow, however, that high declivity favors each element
    of erosion. The effect of declivity on weathering is far from simple.
    For example, great declivity, by allowing more of the rainfall to flow
    off over the surface, and by causing it to flow off more promptly,
    restricts the work of solution, and therefore of decomposition, both
    at the surface and beneath it. High declivity is also unfavorable to
    the growth of vegetation, and so to the wedge-work of roots. On the
    other hand, a given amount of wedge-work of roots and ice is more
    effective where the slope is steep than where it is gentle, for such
    materials as are loosened descend the slopes more readily. The prompt
    removal of weathered materials, by exposing fresh surfaces of rock,
    accelerates weathering. The total amount of weathering may therefore
    not be diminished by the increase of slope, even though certain of its
    processes are hindered.</p>

  <p>The effect of high declivity on transportation, the second element of
    erosion, is too patent to need explanation.</p>

  <p>Corrasion likewise is favored by high declivity, for the abrasive power
    of a stream increases as the square of its velocity. With corrasive
    power increased, corrasion will also be increased if the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> has
    tools to work with. Since high declivity greatly increases both the
    transporting and the corrasive power of running water, and favors
    certain elements of weathering, it is clear that the aggregate effect
    of high declivity is to favor erosion, whether in the channel of the
    stream or on the general surface of its drainage basin.</p>

  <h4><i>The Influence of Rock.</i></h4>

  <p>The physical constitution, the chemical composition, and the
    stratigraphy of a rock formation, influence the rate at which it may
    be broken up and carried away. Clastic or fragmental rocks are usually
    stratified and made up of cemented pebbles (conglomerate), sand grains
    (sandstone), or particles of mud (shale). Igneous rocks, such as
    granite, are massive instead of stratified, and are usually made up of
    great numbers of interlocking crystals which bind one another together.
    Some crystalline rocks, such as schists, though not stratified, possess
    cleavage, which has much the effect of stratification, so far as
    erosion is concerned. All rocks are affected by systems of more or less
    nearly vertical cracks called <i>joints</i>. All these structures have
    their influence upon the rate of degradation.</p>

  <p><b>Physical constitution.—</b>Clastic rocks may be firmly cemented,
    or their constituents may be loosely bound together. The less the
    coherence the more ready the disintegration, and the finer the
    particles the more easily are they carried away. When the particles in
    transportation are angular they effect more wear on the bed over which
    they move, and on one another, than when they are round. The difference
    is great where the particles are large, and little where they are very
    small. If the materials carried be harder than the bed over which they
    pass, corrasion of the latter is favored.</p>

  <p><b>Chemical composition.—</b>Something also depends on the chemical
    composition of the rock, since this affects its solubility, and
    therefore its rate of decomposition. The more soluble the rock the
    larger the proportion of it which will be taken away in solution; but
    it does not follow that the most soluble rock will be most rapidly
    eroded, since the rate of erosion depends on abrasion as well as
    solution, and a rock which is readily soluble, as rocks go, may be less
    easily abraded than a rock which is made of discrete and insoluble
    particles bound together by a soluble cement. In such rocks, for
    example a sandstone in which the grains are cemented together by
    lime carbonate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> the solution of the cement sets free a considerable
    quantity of sand, so that a small amount of solution prepares a large
    amount of sediment for removal. A stream might cut its valley much
    more rapidly in such a sandstone than in a compact limestone, though
    the latter is, as a whole, the more soluble. The constituent minerals
    of crystalline rocks resist solution and decay unequally, and when any
    one is dissolved or decomposed the rock crumbles and the less soluble
    constituents are ready for removal by mechanical means. So long as the
    material loosened by disintegration is removed, chemical heterogeneity
    favors erosion; but if the loosened débris is not removed erosion is
    not favored by chemical heterogeneity. In such a case erosion would be
    most rapid where the rock was most soluble.</p>

  <p><b>Structure.—</b>The structure of the rock has much to do with the
    rate of its erosion. Other things being equal, stratified rock is
    more readily eroded than massive rock, since stratification-planes
    are planes of cleavage, and therefore of weakness. Taking advantage
    of these planes the water has less breaking to perform to reduce
    the material to a transportable condition. For the same reason a
    thin-bedded formation is more easily eroded than a thick-bedded one.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig103">
    <img class="illowp75" src="images/fig103_104.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 103 and 104.—Diagrams to illustrate the
      fact that a stream crosses many more cleavage-planes when the beds of
      rock are inclined than when they are horizontal.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The beds of stratified rock may be horizontal, vertical, or inclined,
    and inclined strata may stand at any angle between horizontality and
    verticality. In indurated formations the rate of erosion is influenced
    both by the position of the strata and by the relation of the direction
    of the flowing water to their dip and strike. On the whole the strata
    which are horizontal, or but slightly inclined, are probably less
    favorable for rapid erosion than those which are vertical or inclined
    at considerable angles. This is at least true where the layers are of
    uniform hardness and the joints infrequent.</p>

  <p>Horizontal strata expose fewer cleavage planes to the water flowing
    over them than strata in any other position. In <a href="#fig103"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 103</a> the stream
    which has the profile ad crosses bedding-planes at <i>b</i> and
    <i>c</i>. In <a href="#fig103"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 104</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> where the beds dip up-stream, many more
    division-planes are crossed in the same distance. Since bedding-planes
    are planes of weakness, it follows that horizontal and nearly
    horizontal strata are not, under ordinary conditions of erosion, in a
    position favorable for most rapid wear. When strata are horizontal, it
    makes no difference which way the stream runs, for the current sustains
    the same relation to the cleavage-planes whatever its course.</p>

  <p>In the case of incoherent material the position of the beds, or even
    their existence, has little influence on the rate of erosion. Such
    formations are weak in all directions, not simply along bedding-planes.</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp50" id="fig105">
    <img src="images/fig105.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 105.—Diagram to illustrate the various
      relations a stream may sustain to the outcrop of vertical layers of rock.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>When the strata are vertical, three distinct cases may arise (<a href="#fig105"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    105</a>). The stream may flow (1) with the strike (<i>aa</i>); (2) at right
    angles to the strike (<i>bb</i>); or (3) oblique to it (<i>cc</i>) at
    any angle whatsoever. It is perhaps not possible to say which of these
    positions is most favorable for erosion, for the character of the rock,
    the thickness of its layers, its ability to stand with steep slopes,
    and the strength of the currents concerned, would influence the result.
    A stream which flows at right angles to the strike (<i>bb</i>, <a href="#fig105"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    105</a>) would cross more cleavage-planes in a given distance than a stream
    flowing in any other direction, and would strike the outcropping edges
    of layers at the angle of greatest advantage. A stream flowing along
    the strike (<i>aa</i>), on the other hand, has better opportunity to
    sink its channel on cleavage-planes, and the current oblique to the
    strike (<i>cc</i>), has some of the advantages of each of the others.</p>

  <figure class="figright illowp50" id="fig106">
    <img src="images/fig106.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 106.—Diagram to illustrate the various relations a
      stream may sustain to the outcrops of inclined layers of rock.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>When the strata are inclined five cases may arise. (1) The stream
    may be parallel to the strike (<i>aa</i>, <a href="#fig106"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 106</a>), when it makes
    no difference which way the current flows; it may be at right angles
    to the strike (<i>bb′</i>), and (2) flowing with the dip (toward
    <i>b′</i>), or (3) against it (toward <i>b</i>); it may be oblique to
    the strike, and flowing (4) in the general direction of dip (toward
    <i>c′</i>); or (5) in the opposite direction (toward <i>c</i>). As
    before, the stream flowing at right angles to the strike would cross
    the largest number of layers in a given distance, and so have an
    opportunity to take advantage of more cleavage-planes than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> a stream in
    any other position. But in the case of inclined strata a new element
    enters into the problem. When the stream flows parallel to the strike,
    the valley which is in process of deepening is not sunk vertically,
    but is shifted more or less in the direction of the dip (<a href="#fig107"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 107</a>).
    This is called <i>monoclinal shifting</i>. The result is that there
    is a constant tendency to undermine (sap) the valley bluff on the
    down-dip side, and this process of sapping will, according to its rate,
    accelerate the growth of the valley, especially in width. Monoclinal
    shifting is favored by the presence of a hard layer (<i>H</i>), as
    shown in <a href="#fig107"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 107</a>, if this stratum is the bed of the stream.</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp45" id="fig107">
    <img src="images/fig107.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 107.—Diagram to illustrate monoclinal shifting. The
      valley <i>abc</i>, as seen in cross-section, becomes <i>deb</i>, as the
      stream lowers its channel.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the second and third cases mentioned above, the only difference is
    in the angle at which the current strikes the outcropping edges of
    layers and laminæ. The mechanical advantage is with the stream which
    flows with the dip. In the fourth and fifth cases something will
    depend on the angle which the stream’s course makes with the strike.
    In all these cases, as in those where the strata are vertical, much
    will depend on the thickness and resistance of the layers and on the
    strength of the currents concerned.</p>

  <h4><i>The Influence of Climate.</i></h4>

  <p>Climate has both a direct and an indirect effect on erosion. Its
    direct influence is through precipitation, evaporation, changes of
    temperature, and wind; its indirect, through vegetation. Like declivity
    and rock structure, climate does not affect all elements of erosion
    equally.</p>

  <p>The chief elements of climate are temperature, moisture, and
    atmospheric movements; the principal factors which influence it are
    latitude, altitude, distance from the sea, direction of prevailing
    winds, and topographic relations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p>The effects of variations in temperature on rock weathering have
    already been discussed (<a href="#Page_43"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 43</a>). They are chiefly mechanical, and are
    seen at their best where the daily range is great.</p>

  <p>High temperature favors chemical action, and the weathering of rock
    by decomposition is at its best in the presence of abundant moisture
    in regions where the temperature is uniformly high. Furthermore, a
    warm moist climate favors the growth of vegetation, the decay of which
    supplies the water with organic acids which greatly increase its
    solvent power. The climatic conditions favoring mechanical weathering
    are therefore different from those favoring chemical weathering. High
    temperature and abundant moisture and vegetation are found in many
    tropical regions, and here the rock is often decomposed to greater
    depths, on the whole, than in high latitudes. How far this is the
    result of rapid weathering, and how far of slow removal, due in part
    to the protective influence of the plants, cannot be affirmed. If the
    weathered material is not removed, it will presently become a mantle
    thick enough to retard the processes which brought it into existence.</p>

  <p>So long as the water of the surface and that in the soil remains
    unfrozen, temperature affects neither corrasion nor transportation.
    But in middle and high latitudes the surface is frozen for some part
    of each year. During this time corrasion is at a minimum, for although
    the streams continue to flow there is relatively little water running
    over the surface outside the drainage channels, and that little is
    relatively ineffective. Under some conditions, therefore, temperature
    affects both corrasion and transportation.</p>

  <p>The humidity of the atmosphere has an influence even more important
    than that of temperature on the rate of erosion, and its influence
    is exerted on each of the elements of that complex process. A moist
    atmosphere favors oxidation, carbonation, hydration, and the growth of
    vegetation, all of which promote certain phases of rock weathering.
    On the other hand, humidity tends to prevent sudden and considerable
    variations in temperature, thus checking the weathering effected
    by this means. Precipitation, the most important single factor in
    determining the rate of erosion, is dependent on atmospheric humidity.
    Its amount, its kind (rain or snow), and its distribution in time, are
    the elements which determine its effectiveness in any given place.</p>

  <p>Other things being equal the greater the amount of precipitation
    the more rapid the corrasion and transportation. Much, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
    depends on its distribution in time. A given amount of rainfall may
    be distributed equally through the year, or it may fall during a
    wet season only. The maximum inequality of distribution would occur
    if all the rainfall of a given period were concentrated in a single
    shower. With such concentration the volume of water flowing off over
    the surface immediately after the down-pour would be greater than
    under any other conditions of precipitation, and since velocity is
    increased with volume, and erosive power with velocity, it follows
    that the erosive power of a given amount of water would be greater
    under these circumstances than under any other. Furthermore, a larger
    proportion of the precipitation would run off over the surface under
    these circumstances than under any other, for less of it would sink
    beneath the surface and less would be evaporated. If erosive power
    and rate of erosion were equal terms, this would therefore be the
    condition for greatest erosion; but erosive power and rate of erosion
    do not always correspond. If the water falling in this way could
    get hold of all the material it could carry, extreme concentration
    of precipitation would be the condition favorable for most rapid
    erosion. But if the amount of available material for transportation
    is slight, a large part of the force of the water could not be
    utilized in erosion. It follows that if there were a large amount of
    disintegrated material on the surface, erosion would be greater the
    greater the concentration of precipitation. If, on the other hand,
    there were but little disintegrated material on the surface, frequent
    showers, with intervening periods when conditions were favorable for
    weathering, that is, for preparing material for transportation, might
    be more favorable for rapid erosion. While the total energy of running
    water available for erosion under these conditions would be less than
    before, there might in the long run be more material for transport;
    for weathering in the presence of moisture, and all that goes with
    it, might be more effective in preparing material for transportation,
    than weathering during the long periods of drought which would occur
    if the precipitation were concentrated to its maximum. Temperature
    favoring, the uniform distribution of moisture through the year would
    allow the growth of vegetation, which, although favoring some processes
    of weathering, retards erosion in general. While therefore it is not
    possible to say what distribution of rainfall favors most rapid erosion
    without knowing the nature of the surface on which it is to fall,
    enough has been said to show that the problem is by no means a simple
    one. Some of the most striking phases of topography<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> developed by
    erosion, such as those of the Bad Lands (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig075">75 to 78</a>, and <a href="#fig108">108</a>), are
    developed where the rainfall is unequally distributed in time, and too
    slight or too infrequent to support abundant vegetation.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig108">

  </figure>

  <p>During its fall, and immediately after, rain is more effective than
    an equal amount of snow; but the snow may be accumulated through
    a considerable period of the year, and then melted rapidly, when
    it has an effect comparable to that which would be produced by the
    concentration of the rainfall into a limited period of the year. If
    the ground beneath be frozen when the snow melts (and this is often
    the case) the erosion accomplished by the resulting water will be
    diminished.</p>

  <p>Except in dry regions, where wind-work sometimes exceeds water-work,
    the movements of the atmosphere are of less importance directly
    than precipitation in determining the rate of erosion. But even in
    regions which are not arid the winds have much to do with the rate of
    evaporation and the distribution of rainfall, so that their indirect
    effect is great. Even their direct effects in moist climates are not to
    be lost sight of, for even here the surface is sometimes dry enough to
    yield dust and sand, and the uprooting of trees so disturbs the surface
    as to make earthy débris more accessible to wind and water. Where trees
    gain precarious footholds on steep slopes, as they often do, they are
    likely to be overturned as soon as they are large enough to offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    considerable resistance to the wind, and in the overturning, large
    quantities of rock are sometimes loosened and carried down the slope
    by gravity. This phase of destructive work is seen at its best on the
    walls of gorges, where trees often flourish until their tops project
    above the rim of the valley.</p>

  <p>Through vegetation, climate influences erosion in ways which are easily
    defined qualitatively, but not quantitatively. Both by its growth
    (wedge-work of roots) and by its decay (supplying CO<sub>2</sub>, etc., to
    descending waters) it favors certain phases of weathering; but, on
    the other hand, it retards corrasion and transportation both by wind
    and water. This is well shown along the banks of streams and on the
    faces of cliffs, in clay, sand, etc. Its aggregate effect is probably
    unfavorable to erosion by mechanical means, and favorable to that by
    chemical processes.</p>

  <p>Erosion in high arid regions differs from that in regions of abundant
    rainfall in several ways. It is obvious that the valleys will develop
    more slowly in the former, that they will remain young longer, that the
    period necessary for the dissection of the surface is greater, that
    the watercourses will be less numerous, and that fewer of them will
    have permanent streams. There are certain other differences which are
    less obvious. If the arid region be high and composed of heterogeneous
    strata, the topography which erosion develops is more angular (<a href="#fig083"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    83</a>) than that of the humid region. This is because there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> less
    rock decay, and less vegetation to hold the products of decay. The
    more resistant beds of rock therefore come into greater prominence,
    especially on slopes, where they develop cliffs (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig109">109</a> and <a href="#fig110">110</a>).
    These general principles find abundant illustration in the plateaus of
    the western part of the United States,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> where the cliffs are by no
    means confined to the immediate valleys of the streams (<a href="#plate_XIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XII</a>).</p>

  <h3>EFFECTS OF UNEQUAL HARDNESS.</h3>

  <p>In the preceding pages incidental reference has been made to the
    results of inequalities of rock resistance. This topic will now be
    considered more fully.</p>

  <p><b>Rapids and falls.—</b>Returning for a moment to the hypothetical
    island with which our study of erosion began, let a horizontal layer
    of hard rock be assumed to run through it (H, <a href="#fig111"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 111</a>). As the rain
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>falls on the land and runs off over it, wear will be less rapid where
    the hard layer comes to the surface than at the higher or lower levels.
    As a result, the slope will become steeper at and below the outcrop
    of the hard layer, and less steep immediately above it, as shown
    by <i>ab</i> in <a href="#fig111"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 111</a>. Under these conditions the water passing
    over the hard ledge constitutes <i>rapids</i>. The increased erosion
    which accompanies the increased velocity makes the rapids more rapid.
    The process may continue until the water <i>falls</i>, rather than
    <i>flows</i> over the hard layer (<i>cd</i>, <a href="#fig111"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 111</a>). With continued
    rainfall the edges of the hard layer, together with the slopes above
    and below, would continue to recede toward the center of the island.
    Under conditions of absolute homogeneity of material, save for the hard
    layer specified, no valley would be developed, and therefore no stream.</p>

  <p>If the surface was so changed as to allow of the development of a
    valley (<a href="#Page_63"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 63</a>) the same principles would be applicable. As an active
    stream passes from a hard layer to one less resistant, the greater
    wear on the latter gives origin to rapids. At first the rapids would
    be slight (<i>a</i>, <a href="#fig112"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 112</a>), but would become more considerable
    (<i>b</i>) as time and erosion go on. When the bed of the rapids
    becomes sufficiently steep, the rapids become <i>falls</i><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
    (<i>cd</i>). When the water falls rather than flows over the rock
    surface below the hard layer, erosion assumes a new phase. The hard
    layer is then undermined, and the undermining causes the falls to
    recede. This phase of erosion is sometimes called <i>sapping</i>.</p>

      which exist at Niagara Falls. (Gilbert.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If the hard layer which occasions a fall dips up-stream (<a href="#fig112"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 112</a>),
    its outcrop in the stream’s bed becomes lower as the fall recedes
    (<i>e</i>). When it has become so low that the water passing over it no
    longer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>reacts effectively against the less resistant material beneath
    (<i>f</i>), sapping ceases, and the point of greatest erosion may be
    shifted from the soft material beneath the fall to the hard layer
    itself. The actual rate of erosion at this point may be no greater than
    before, though the relative rate is. Under these circumstances the
    vertical edge of the hard layer will presently be converted into an
    incline (<i>f</i>), and as this takes place the fall becomes rapids.
    The conversion of the falls into the rapids begins about the time
    the lower edge of the hard stratum in the channel reaches grade. By
    continuation of the process which transformed the falls into rapids,
    the rapids become less rapid, and when the upper edge of the hard layer
    has been brought to grade, the rapids disappear (<i>h</i>, <a href="#fig112"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 112</a>).
    The history of rapids which succeed falls is the reverse of that which
    preceded. The later rapids are steepest at the beginning of their
    history, the earlier at their end. Stated in other terms, rapids are
    steepest when nearest falls in time. Slight differences in hardness in
    successive layers often occasion successive falls or rapids (<a href="#fig114"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 114</a>).</p>

  <p>If the hard layer which occasions the falls be horizontal, instead of
    dipping up-stream, the general result would be the same; but, other
    things being equal, the duration of the falls developed under these
    conditions would be greater, since they must recede farther before
    becoming rapids.</p>

  <p>If the layers of unequal hardness in a stream’s bed be vertical and the
    course of the stream at right angles to the strike, rapids, and perhaps
    falls, will develop (<a href="#fig115"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 115</a>). The chances for falls are greater,
    the greater the difference in hardness. Falls developed under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> these
    conditions, as well as the rapids preceding and following, would remain
    constant in position until the resistant layer was brought to grade,
    but they would ultimately disappear as in the preceding cases. Falls
    are not likely to develop where the strata of the stream’s bed dip
    down-stream, though they may develop even under these conditions if the
    gradient of the stream is greater than the dip of the strata (<a href="#fig116"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 116</a>).</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The inequality of resistance in the rock which occasions a fall may
    be original or secondary. In the case of Niagara Falls<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> (<a href="#fig113"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    113</a>) relatively resistant limestone overlies relatively weak shale.
    At the Falls of St. Anthony (Minneapolis) limestone overlies friable
    sandstone. The falls of the Yellowstone and the Shoshone Falls of
    the Snake River (Idaho), are in igneous rock. In the former case the
    unequal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>resistance is occasioned by unequal decay of the rock, due
    perhaps to the rise of hot vapors which have decomposed the rock along
    the lines of their ascent; in the latter, a more resistant sort of
    igneous rock overlies a less resistant.</p>

  <p>Structural features, such as jointing, sometimes give rise to falls,
    or determine their distinctive features (<a href="#fig117"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 117</a>), even where the
    formations involved are of uniform hardness. A joint plane has the
    effect of a weak vertical or highly inclined bed. If an open joint
    is discovered in a stream’s bed, the water enters it. If it finds an
    outlet below, a channel is worn along the new line of flow, with rapids
    or falls where the water descends. Rock originally homogeneous may be
    much fractured in some parts, while it remains unbroken in others.
    Where a stream passes from the solid to the broken portion rapids, or
    even falls, may develop.</p>

      of falls where the beds dip down-stream.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Falls may originate in still other ways. If for any reason a stream is
    forced out of its valley, it may in its flow find entrance to another
    valley, or to another part of its own valley, over a steep slope. If
    the structure of the slope favors, a fall may speedily develop. The
    Falls of St. Anthony are an example, the Mississippi having been turned
    out of its earlier course by deposits of glacial drift. Again, if an
    obstruction of any sort, such as a flow of lava, dams a stream, rapids
    or falls are developed where the water overflows the dam. When a main
    valley is notably deepened by glaciation the drainage from tributary
    valleys may fall into it, if the tributaries were not equally deepened.
    Falls which originated in this way are common in the western mountains
    of the United States, as well as in most mountain regions recently
    affected by local glaciers (<a href="#fig118"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 118</a>).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

  <p>One waterfall often breeds others. Thus where a fall recedes beyond
    the mouth of a tributary stream, the tributary falls. The Falls of
    Minnehaha, on a small tributary to the Mississippi, near Minneapolis,
    may serve as an illustration. In such cases the falls may not develop
    from rapids. Once in existence, the fall of a tributary follows the
    same history as that of a main stream.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Streams which have falls are relatively clear.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> If a stream
    favorably situated for the development of a fall carried a heavy
    load, deposition would take place below the rapids, and the tendency
    would <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>be to aggrade the channel at that point and so to prevent
    the development of the fall. Falls occur only on streams which have
    relatively high gradients. This means that the streams which have falls
    are well above base-level, and streams well above base-level are young.
    Falls therefore are a mark of topographic youth.</p>

  <p>The fall of the Niagara<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> (<a href="#plate_IX"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> IX</a>) is one of the most remarkable
    known, both because of its large volume of water and its great descent,
    between 160 and 170 feet. The rate at which the fall is receding is a
    matter of interest not only in itself, but because, once determined,
    it may be made to serve as a unit of measurement for certain important
    events in geological history. It was formerly conjectured that this
    fall was receding at the rate of one to three feet per century, but
    it was not until recent years that its actual rate of recession was
    approximately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> fixed. By surveys executed in 1842 and 1890 it has been
    determined that its average rate of recession between those dates was
    something like 4½ feet per year, or about 150 times as great as the
    highest estimate stated above. It is to be noted that this is the
    <i>average</i> rate of recession, for all parts of the ledge over which
    the water falls are not receding at the same rate. The point of the
    “Horseshoe” has, during the same time, gone back at more than twice
    this rate.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

  </figure>

  <p>Rapids and falls sometimes occasion the development of <i>pot-holes</i>
    (<a href="#fig119"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 119</a>), a peculiar rather than important erosion feature. The holes
    are excavated in part by the falling and eddying of silt-charged water,
    but chiefly by stones which the eddies move. Pot-holes which are not
    now in immediate association with rapids or falls often point to the
    former existence of rapids or falls.</p>

  <p><b>Rock terraces.—</b>The tendency to sapping shown in many waterfalls
    is also shown in the weathering and erosion of the sides of a valley
    where a hard layer outcrops above the bottom, and the profile of
    the side slopes of the valley simulates that of the stream; that
    is, the slope becomes gentle just above the hard layer, and steep,
    or even vertical, at and below its outcrop. This is illustrated by
    <a href="#fig120"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 120</a>, where the hard layer through which the stream has sunk its
    valley stands out as a rock terrace on either side of the valley.
    Such terraces are not rare and are popularly believed to be old
    “water-lines”; that is, to represent the height at which the water once
    stood. In one sense this interpretation is correct, since a river has
    stood at all levels between that of the surface in which its valley
    started, and its present channel, but the shelf of hard rock does not
    mean that the river, after attaining its present channel, was ever so
    large as to fill the valley to the level of the terrace. Rock terraces
    may also result from changes of level.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

      of rock terraces.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Narrows.—</b>Inequalities in hardness occasion another peculiarity
    common to valleys. If a stream crosses vertical or highly inclined
    strata of unequal hardness, its valley is usually constricted at the
    crossing of the harder layers. If such a constriction be notable it is
    called a <i>narrows</i>, or sometimes a <i>water-gap</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig121">121</a>,
    <a href="#fig159">159</a>, and <a href="#plate_XIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XII</a>). The Appalachian Mountains afford numerous
    examples. The constriction arises because the processes which widen the
    valley are less effective on the hard layer than on the less resistant
    ones on either hand. Though most narrows are due to the superior
    resistance of the rock where they occur, they are sometimes the result
    of other causes.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Narrows are much more conspicuous in certain stages of erosion than
    in others. While a valley is still so young as to be narrow at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> all
    points, no narrows will be conspicuous; but at a later stage in
    its history, when the valley is otherwise wide, narrows are more
    pronounced. At a still later stage, when the hard strata themselves
    approach base-level, the narrows again become inconspicuous.</p>

  <p>From what has preceded it is clear that rapids or falls are likely to
    occur at narrows, especially in the early part of their history.</p>

  <p><b>Other effects on topography.—</b>Inequalities in the hardness of
    rock develop certain peculiarities of topography other than those
    of valleys. The less resistant portions of a land area more or less
    distant from streams are worn down more readily than those which are
    more resistant. If great areas of high land be capped with hard rock
    they are likely to remain as plateaus after surrounding areas of
    less resistance are brought low. If the hard capping affects a small
    area instead of a large one, the elevation is a butte, a hill, or a
    mountain, instead of a plateau (<a href="#fig110"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 110</a>). Many buttes and small mesas
    are but remnants of former plateaus (Mesa Lauriano, N. M., <a href="#plate_XIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr>
    XII</a>). A feature of buttes and mesas capped by hard rock is the steep
    slope or cliff corresponding to the edge of the hard bed (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig078">78</a> and
    <a href="#fig109">109</a>).</p>

      of hard Jurassic rock. Wyoming.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If the rock of a region be stratified and the layers tilted, the
    removal of the softer beds leaves the harder ones projecting above
    the general level in the form of ridges or “hog-backs” (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig122">122</a>
    and <a href="#fig123">123</a>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> Dikes of igneous rock, harder than the beds which they
    intersect, likewise become ridges after the degradation of their
    surroundings. The plugs of old volcanic vents and other igneous
    intrusions of limited area often constitute conspicuous hills or
    mountains after erosion has removed their less resistant surroundings
    (<a href="#fig124"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 124</a>). Inequalities of hardness are therefore responsible for many
    hills and ridges. In the isolation of the hills and ridges picturesque
    coves are developed, where the attitude and distribution of the weak
    and strong rocks are propitious. The bottoms of the coves are located
    on the weak rocks, and above them rise the precipitous slopes of
    the resistant ones. Round valley (<a href="#plate_XVIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XVII</a>,

  <p>Ridges and hills resulting from the unequal degradation of unequally

    of their surroundings still remain about them; but in late maturity
    or early old age the outcropping masses of hard rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> have been more
    perfectly isolated and are most conspicuous. Most of the even-crested

  <p><b>Adjustment of streams to rock structures.—</b>Valleys (gullies)
    locate themselves at the outset without immediate regard to the
    hardness and softness of their beds. It is primarily the slope about
    the head of a gully which determines its line of growth, though
    relative hardness often determines the details of slope, even in the
    early stages of an erosion cycle. Once established, streams tend to
    hold their courses, even if this involves the crossing of resistant
    layers.</p>

  <p>While a region where more and less resistant layers of rock come to the
    surface is in a youthful stage of erosion, some of the valleys (and
    therefore the streams) are likely to be located on the less resistant
    rock, some on the more resistant, and some partly on the one and partly
    on the other. The streams on the weaker rock will deepen their valleys
    more rapidly than the others, and those which flow across stronger
    and weaker rocks alternately will deepen their valleys more rapidly
    than those which run on hard rock all the time. The former conclusion
    is self-evident. The latter appears from the fact that rapids will be
    likely to develop at the crossing of each hard layer, thus accelerating
    erosion at those points. Such a stream therefore not only has less hard
    rock to erode than one which flows on resistant rock all the time, but
    it erodes that which it does cross much faster.</p>

      Beaverdam Creek by the Shenandoah <abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr>-<abbr title="West Virginia">W.&nbsp;Va.</abbr> (After Willis.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Streams which do not cross hard layers therefore have an advantage
    over those which do, and the tributaries to such streams, since they
    join deeper mains, have an advantage over the tributaries to the
    others. The valleys of the former may lengthen until their heads reach
    the latter, and capture their streams. This sequence of events is
    illustrated in the accompanying diagrams (<a href="#fig125"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 125–27</a>). Even where
    several streams cross the same resistant bed, piracy is likely to take
    place among them, for some are sure to deepen their valleys faster than
    others, because of inequalities of volume, load, or hardness. This is
    illustrated by <a href="#fig128"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 128–30</a>. An actual case is shown in <a href="#fig131"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 131,
    132</a>. Though piracy may take place when streams do not flow over rock
    of unequal hardness (<a href="#Page_103"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103</a>), it is much more common where unequal
    resistance of the rock puts one stream at a disadvantage as compared
    with another.</p>

  <p>The changes in the courses of streams, by means of which they come to
    sustain definite and stable relations to the rock structure beneath,
    are known as processes of <i>adjustment</i>.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Since streams and
    valleys adjust themselves to other conditions as well, this phase of
    adjustment may be called <i>structural adjustment</i>. Structural
    adjustment is not uncommon among rivers flowing over strata which
    are vertical or highly inclined, since in these positions the hard
    and soft strata are most likely to come to the surface in frequent
    alternation. The smaller streams suffer capture and adjustment first,
    since, as a rule, they have shallower valleys. It often happens that
    main streams, because of their deeper valleys, hold courses not in
    adjustment with structure (the Delaware, the Susquehanna, etc.), while
    tributary streams are captured, diverted, and adjusted. The capture of
    a tributary, however, leads both to the diminution of its main and to
    the increase of its captor, and the weakened stream may ultimately fall
    a prey to the one which is strengthened.</p>

  <p>The processes of adjustment go on until the streams flow as much as
    possible on the weaker beds, and as little as possible on the stronger,
    when adjustment is complete. This amounts to the same thing as saying
    that the outcrops of the hard layers tend to become divides. In many
    cases an area is so situated that there is no escape for its drainage
    except across resistant rock. In this case its drainage is completely
    adjusted when as few streams as possible cross the resistant rock, and
    these by the shortest routes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

  <p>Adjustment has been carried to a high degree of perfection in most
    parts of the Appalachian system. Here, as in all other mountains of
    similar structure, strata of unequal hardness were folded into ridges.
    In this case, the folds have been truncated by erosion, exposing the
    more and the less resistant beds (<i>H</i> and <i>S</i> respectively)
    in alternate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> belts along the flanks of the truncated folds (<i>ab</i>
    and <i>cd</i>, <a href="#fig133"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 133</a>). The streams, especially the lesser ones,
    now flow along the strike of the softer beds much more commonly than
    elsewhere, and where they cross the hard layers it is usually at right
    angles to the strike. This is shown in <a href="#fig134"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 134</a>, where the arrows
    indicate the direction of strike.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> In the history of these rivers,
    however, a factor is involved which has not yet been considered, and
    these streams will be referred to later.</p>

    superimposition. The consequent stream on the upper formation is
    superimposed on the underlying structures when the upper bed has been
    cut through.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>As base-level is approached, the outcrops of hard rock are brought
    low. When they have been reduced to the level of their surroundings,
    the streams may flow without regard to the resistance of the rock
    beneath, for downward cutting has ceased. As this stage of erosion is
    approached, a readjustment of the drainage may take place, and the
    waters which had taken long and circuitous courses to avoid hard rock,
    may change their courses to more direct ones (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig128">130</a> and
    <a href="#fig135">135</a>). Adjustment is, therefore, a relative term, and streams which
    are adjusted at one stage of erosion, are not necessarily adjusted at
    another.</p>

  <p>It sometimes happens that rocks of unequal resistance are covered
    by beds of uniform hardness. A consequent stream developed on the
    latter may find itself out of structural adjustment when it has cut
    its channel down to the level of the heterogeneous beds below. Such a
    stream is said to be <i>superimposed</i> (<a href="#fig136"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 136</a>) on the underlying
    structure. Structural adjustment is likely to follow.</p>

  <h3>INFLUENCE OF JOINTS AND FOLDS.</h3>

  <p><b>Joints.—</b>Various structural features of rock other than hardness
    influence its erosion. Apart from the stratification planes, most rock
    formations are affected by joints or fissures. The joints are often,
    but not always, nearly vertical. Two sets are generally present, and
    sometimes more. If but two, they usually meet at a large angle; if more
    than two, two are likely to be nearly perpendicular to each other,
    while the third and fourth sets have such directions as to cut the
    others at large angles. These joints allow the ingress of water, roots,
    etc., which help to weather and disrupt rocks. Occasionally there is
    notable sag of the beds of rock along joint planes, but this effect
    is usually superficial only (<a href="#fig137"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 137</a>). Where the jointage planes are
    frequent and open, the columns bounded by them sometimes topple over on
    cliff faces, either by undercutting, or by the wedge-work of roots or
    ice.</p>

  <p>The effect of joints on erosion may often be seen along a stream
    which flows in a rock gorge. In such situations, the outlines of the
    banks are sometimes angular, and sometimes crenate (<a href="#fig138"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 138</a>), the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
    reëntrants being located at the joints. By working into and widening
    joints, running water sometimes isolates masses of rock as islands
    (<a href="#fig139"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 139</a>). In a region free from mantle rock, or where the mantle rock
    is meagre, joints often determine the courses of valleys by directing
    the course of surface drainage. This is shown in many parts of the
    arid west. In regions where the rocks are notably faulted, the courses
    of the streams are sometimes controlled by the courses of the fault
    planes. This is the case, for example, in central Washington.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

  </figure>

  <p>The jointing of rocks often shows itself distinctly in the weathered
    faces of cliffs (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig140">140</a> and <a href="#fig141">141</a>), especially in arid and semi-arid
    regions, or where the slope is too steep for the accumulation of soil
    and rock-waste on its surface.</p>

  <p>If a stream flowing over jointed rock has falls, the conditions are
    sometimes afforded for the development of an exceptional and striking
    scenic feature. If above Niagara Falls, for example, there were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>an
    open joint in the bed of the stream (as at <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig142"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 142</a>), some
    portion of the water would descend through it. After reaching a lower
    level it might find or make a passage through the rock to the river
    below the falls. If even a little water took such a course, the flow
    would enlarge its channel, making a passageway between the joint
    through which the water descended and the valley below the falls
    (<i>bcde</i>, <a href="#fig142"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 142</a>). This passageway might become large enough to
    accommodate all the water of the river. In this case, the entire fall
    would be transferred from the position which it previously occupied
    (<i>f</i>) to the position of the enlarged joint (<i>b</i>). The fall
    would then recede. The underground channel between the old falls and
    the new would be bridged by rock (<i>bf″</i> and <i>f‴</i>, <a href="#fig143"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 143</a>),
    making a <i>natural bridge</i>. The natural bridge near Lexington, <abbr title="Virginia">Va.</abbr>
    (<a href="#fig144"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 144</a>), almost 200 feet above the stream which flows beneath it, is
    believed to have been developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> in this way. A similar bridge is now
    in process of development in Two Medicine River in northwestern Montana
    (<a href="#fig145"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 145</a>). Once in existence, a natural bridge will slowly weather
    away.</p>

  <p><b>Folds.—</b>The erosion of folded strata (anticlines and synclines)
    leads to the development of distinctive topographic features. So soon
    as a fold begins to be lifted, it is, by reason of its position,
    subject to more rapid erosion than its surroundings. For the same
    reason the crest of the fold is likely to be degraded more rapidly
    than its lower slopes, and must suffer more degradation before it is
    brought to base-level. Folds are usually composed of beds of unequal
    resistance, and as the degradation of a fold proceeds, successive
    layers are worn from the top, and the alternating hard and soft layers
    composing it are exposed. So soon as this is accomplished, adjustment
    of the streams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> is likely to begin, and the watercourses, and later the
    valley plains, come to be located on the outcrops of the less resistant
    layers, while the outcrops of the harder beds become ridges.</p>

  <p>If the axis of an eroded anticline were horizontal, a given hard layer,
    the arch of which has been cut off, would, after erosion, outcrop on
    both sides of the axis. When the topography was mature these outcrops
    would constitute parallel ridges, or parallel lines of hills; when the
    region had been base-leveled, the outcrops would be in parallel belts,
    though no longer ridges or hills. The lower the plane of truncation,
    the farther apart would the outcrops be in the anticline, and the
    nearer together in the syncline (compare <i>ab</i> and <i>cd</i>, <a href="#fig133"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    133</a>).</p>

  </figure>

  <p>If, on the other hand, the axis of the anticline or syncline to
    be eroded was not horizontal, that is, if it <i>plunged</i>, the
    topographic result would be somewhat different. Suppose a plunging
    anticline to be truncated at base-level. If either end of the fold
    plunged below the plane of truncation, the outcrops of a given layer
    on opposite sides of the axis would converge in the direction of
    plunge, and come together at the end. At a stage of erosion antedating
    planation (say late maturity) there would have been a ridge, or a
    succession of hills, in the position corresponding to the outcrop of
    a hard layer, with a canoe-shaped valley within. If two hard layers
    were involved, instead of one, there would be two encircling ridges,
    with a curved valley between them, and a canoe-shaped valley within
    the innermost (<a href="#fig146"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 146</a>). If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> the anticline plunged both ways, the
    valley enclosed by the hard-layer ridge would be canoe-shaped at both
    ends (<a href="#fig147"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 147</a>). In such a case there would be likely to be a low gap
    (water-gap) in the rim of the valley through which the drainage which
    degraded the surface escaped, but there would be likely to be but one,
    for if two or more streams had drained the area of the valley at an
    early stage of erosion, one would be likely to have captured the others
    (see <a href="#Page_138"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 138</a>) before late maturity. A succession of doubly-plunging
    anticlines and synclines might give rise to a very complex series of
    ridges and valleys. Illustrations of the above phenomena are found at
    various points in the Appalachian Mountains, especially in eastern
    Pennsylvania.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

  <p>In the structural adjustment which goes with the erosion of
    folds, it often happens that the valleys come to be located on the
    anticlines, while the outcrops of the hard layers on the flanks of the
    anticlines, or even in the original synclines, become the mountains.
    The adjustments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> by which valleys come to be located on anticlines
    are somewhat as follows:<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> <a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 148</a> represents two doubly-plunging
    anticlines with a syncline between, the relative elevations being shown
    by contour lines. At the outset, the drainage of such a region must
    have followed the structural valley, and its initial course, consequent
    on the slope, must have been down the axial trough. Drainage from the
    anticlines into the synclines would have promptly developed valleys,
    and the valleys would soon have acquired streams.</p>

  <p>The anticlines and synclines under consideration are assumed to have a
    thick hard layer at the surface, and softer beds below. This is shown
    in the cross-section introduced in the figure, the upper hard stratum
    (<i>m</i>) being indicated by the dots, while the softer one (<i>n</i>)
    is white. The line <i>oo</i> represents base-level, which is below
    the hard layer both in the syncline and anticline, but much farther
    below in the latter position than in the former. Because of their
    higher gradients, and because of the greater fracturing to which the
    region they drain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>was presumably subject at the time of folding, the
    tributary streams might cut through the hard layer sooner than the main
    stream which they join. This done, they would enlarge their valleys
    rapidly in the softer rock beneath, and secondary tributaries would be
    developed (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 149</a>). When the condition of things represented in <a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    149</a> is reached, the streams <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, tributary to the
    synclinal stream, come into competition. The former has the advantage
    over the latter, because it joins the main stream at a lower level.
    Stream <i>c</i> will therefore be likely to capture <i>d</i>. The
    incipient stages of the capture are stealthy, and the later bold. At
    first the divide between their head waters is shifted northward inch by
    inch, because the gradient toward <i>g</i> is higher than that toward
    <i>e</i>. The capture of the head waters of <i>e</i> is as slow as
    the migration of the divide, until the divide reaches the point where
    <i>e</i> joins <i>f</i>. The stream <i>f</i> is then diverted promptly
    into the valley of <i>g</i>, and is at once led away to <i>c</i> (see
    <a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 150</a>). Strengthened by its increased volume, the stream <i>c</i>
    (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 150</a>) lowers its valley across the hard layer more rapidly than
    before, and so holds the advantage it has gained. Not only this, but
    the beheaded stream <i>d</i> (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 150</a>), because of its diminished
    volume, sinks its valley into the hard layer less rapidly than before,
    and its decrease in power also works to the advantage of the stream
    leading to <i>c</i>. The result is that the divide between <i>fg</i>
    and <i>d</i> does not remain constant, but is driven back step by step
    toward <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>Similarly a tributary to the main stream at <i>b</i> (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 150</a>), may by
    means of its tributary <i>h</i>, capture the waters of <i>fg</i>, and
    lead them to the synclinal valley at <i>b</i> (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 150 and
    151). Deprived of its main source of supply (at <i>c</i>) the synclinal
    stream is greatly diminished above <i>b</i>, and cuts more and more
    slowly, while the stream <i>fgh</i> (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 151</a>), having greater volume
    and working mainly in softer rock, sinks its channel faster than the
    stream in the synclinal axis. Under these circumstances, the stream
    at <i>f</i> may cut its valley below the valley in the synclinal axis
    <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 150</a>). In this event, the divide between <i>f</i> and
    <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 150</a>) may be pushed back until the synclinal stream is
    beheaded at <i>a</i> and carried out of the syncline and over into the
    anticlinal valley (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 151</a>). Thus, the old anticlinal axis comes to
    be the course of the main stream. Similarly the stream entering the
    syncline at <i>b</i> (<a href="#fig148"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 151</a>) might later be captured by <i>i</i>,
    thus lengthening its anticlinal course.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

  <p>It is not to be understood that this sequence of events will take
    place in the degradation of every anticline, but the principles here
    set forth will always be operative. The result specified will be
    accomplished wherever hard and soft layers have the relations indicated
    in the diagrams; that is, where the stream in the syncline finds itself
    on a resistant layer as it approaches base-level, while at the same
    time the (original) tributary streams are working in softer beds. It is
    not to be understood, therefore, that streams migrate from synclines to
    anticlines for the sake of getting out of the former positions into the
    latter. If they shift their courses it is to find easier ones.</p>

  <p>That these changes are not fanciful is shown by the fact that the
    adjustment described corresponds with that shown in many parts of the
    Appalachian Mountains, and in other mountains of similar structure.</p>

  <p>If in a later stage of its history, the new main stream, <i>fh</i>,
    were to cut its bed down to a lower hard layer, while the original
    stream, <i>ab</i>, reached a softer bed beneath the hard one above, the
    latter would again have an advantage, and a new series of adjustments
    would be inaugurated which might result in re-establishing the main
    stream in its original synclinal position.</p>

  <h3>EFFECT OF CHANGES OF LEVEL.</h3>

  <p><b>Rise.—</b>If after being base-leveled, or notably reduced by
    erosion, a region is uplifted so as to increase the gradients and
    therefore the velocities of the streams which drain it, the streams are
    said to be <i>rejuvenated</i>, and a new cycle of erosion is begun.
    If the rise of the area were equal everywhere, while the coast line
    remained constant in position, there would be an immediate increase
    in velocity only at the debouchures of the streams flowing directly
    into the sea. At the debouchures of such streams there would be rapids
    or falls. Each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> rapids or falls would promptly recede, and with the
    recession, the acceleration of velocity resulting from the uplift would
    be felt farther and farther up-stream, and ultimately to its source.
    The rejuvenated streams would cut new valleys in the bottoms of their
    old ones (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig152">152</a> and <a href="#fig153">153</a>). The new valleys would begin where the
    increase in velocity was first felt, and they would be lengthened by
    head erosion just as valleys of the first cycle were lengthened.</p>

  <p>When the head of the new part of a valley of a rejuvenated stream
    recedes past the mouth of a tributary adjusted<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> to the gradient of
    the main stream before rejuvenation, the velocity of the tributary
    is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>accelerated at its debouchure, and it begins to excavate a new
    valley in the bottom of its old one. The new valley commences at the
    lower end of the old one, and develops headward (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
    <a href="#fig153"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 153</a>). Good illustrations are furnished by the streams in the west
    central part of New Jersey. The Delaware has here a sharply defined
    valley, and its tributaries are essentially as deep as their main at
    the point of junction. Above this point they have high gradients for a
    short distance (three to six miles), beyond which they wind sluggishly
    in wide valleys with low gradients across a relatively high plateau.
    Their profiles are illustrated by <a href="#fig154"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 154</a>. The flat, though high,
    surface in which their upper courses lie, appears to have been nearly
    base-leveled in an earlier cycle, and then to have been elevated.
    The date of the elevation is fixed, in terms of erosion, by the time
    necessary for the excavation of the Delaware gorge, and the narrow
    gorges along the lower courses of its tributaries. It was so recent
    that the effects of rejuvenation, proceeding from the debouchures of
    the tributaries toward their heads, have not yet advanced far from the
    Delaware. Similar relations are found elsewhere (<a href="#plate_XIIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XIII</a>,
    s. c. Col.). Another peculiarity of rejuvenated drainage is shown in
    <a href="#plate_XIIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, Plate XIII</a> (s. Kan.). Here Elm Creek flows at a level 200 feet
    below that of Sand Creek, 4 miles distant. The valley of the former
    appears to have entered upon a new cycle as the result of uplift, while
    that of the latter, <i>in the area shown on the map</i>, is still
    unrejuvenated. Farther down-stream, the valley of Sand Creek shows
    signs of rejuvenation. It may be noted that a tributary of Amber Creek
    has good opportunity to capture Sand Creek, for the latter flows about
    25 miles before reaching the level of Amber Creek at its junction with
    Elm Creek.</p>

  <p>Should the lower end of a tributary valley fail to be degraded as fast
    as the valley of the main at the point of junction, the tributary is
    out of <i>topographic adjustment</i> with its main. Falls or rapids may
    result. When the lower end of a tributary valley is distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> above
    the level of its main, the former is called a <i>hanging valley</i>.
    Hanging valleys developed by stream erosion alone are not common except
    just after the recession of a falls past the mouth of a tributary.
    Hanging valleys, as well as the characters and relations illustrated by
    <a href="#fig152"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 152–154</a> are criteria of rejuvenation, but they must be applied
    with discretion. Such profiles, for example, as that shown in <a href="#fig154"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    154</a> may be developed when the rock of a stream’s bed is unequally
    resistant, and hanging valleys are generally a result of glaciation
    (see <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>).</p>

  <p>Rejuvenated streams sometimes inherit certain peculiarities from their
    aged ancestors. Thus a rejuvenated stream may intrench the meanders
    possessed by the old stream which preceded (see <a href="#plate_XIVa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XIV</a>, near
    Harrisburg, Pa.), and intrenched meanders are one of the marks of
    rejuvenated streams. They are not uncommon in the Appalachian Mountain
    regions, and are known in other parts of the world. The Seine and the
    Moselle furnish further illustrations.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

  <p>The history of the new cycle of erosion inaugurated by the uplift would
    differ from that of the preceding cycle in that the new one would begin
    with a drainage system already developed. Other things being equal,
    therefore, the reduction of the land would proceed more rapidly in a
    subsequent cycle than in the first.</p>

  <p>The recognition of different cycles of erosion, separated by uplifts,
    is often easy. The principles involved are illustrated by <a href="#fig155"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 155</a>
    which represents an ideal profile of considerable length (say 50
    miles). The points <i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>, and <i>a″</i> reach a common
    level. Below them there are areas <i>b</i>, <i>b′</i>, and <i>b″</i>
    which have a nearly common elevation, below which are the sharp valleys
    <i>d</i>, <i>d′</i>, and <i>d″</i>. The points <i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>,
    and <i>a″</i> represent the cross-sections of ridges formed by the
    outcrops of layers of hard rock. If the crests of the ridges are
    level, the points <i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>, and <i>a″</i> must represent
    remnants of an old base-level, <i>since at no time after a ridge of
    hard rock becomes deeply notched does it acquire an even crest, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
    it is base-leveled</i>.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> At all earlier stages its crest is uneven.
    After the cycle represented by the remnants <i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>, and
    <i>a″</i> was completed, the region suffered uplift. A new cycle
    represented by the plain <i>b</i>, <i>b′</i>, and <i>b″</i> was well
    advanced, though not completed, when the region was again elevated,
    and the rejuvenated streams began to cut their valleys <i>d</i>,
    <i>d′</i>, and <i>d″</i> in the plain of the previous incomplete cycle.
    The elevations, <i>c</i> and <i>c′</i> (intermediate in elevation
    between <i>a</i>, <i>a′</i>, and <i>a″</i>, and <i>b</i>, <i>b′</i>,
    and <i>b″</i>) may represent either remnants of the first base-level
    plain which were lowered, but not obliterated, while the plane <i>b,
    b′, b″</i> was developing; or they may represent a cycle intermediate
    between that during which <i>a, a′, a″</i> and <i>b, b′, b″</i> were
    developed. If the intermediate elevations (<i>c, c′</i>) have a common
    height and level crests, the presumption would be in favor of the
    latter interpretation. If they be numerous and of varying heights, as
    is possible, they may in the field obscure the planes (<i>a, a′, a″</i>
    and <i>b, b′, b″</i>) developed in the different cycles, which, in the
    figure, are distinct.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 155.—Diagram to illustrate cycles of
    erosion where the beds are tilted.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If the strata involved be horizontal the determination of cycles is
    sometimes less easy. Thus in <a href="#fig156"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 156</a>, it is not possible to say
    whether <i>a</i> and <i>a′</i> represent remnants of an old base-level,
    or whether they represent the original surface from which degradation
    started. So, too, the various benches below <i>a</i>, such as <i>b</i>,
    <i>b′</i>, and <i>b″</i> may readily be the result of the superior
    hardness of the beds at this level. For the determination of successive
    uplifts in the field it is necessary to consider areas of considerable
    size, and to eliminate the topographic effects of inequalities of
    hardness, and of certain other factors to be mentioned presently.</p>

  <p>The inequalities in the depths of the young valleys in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig155">155</a> and
    <a href="#fig156">156</a> may be explained on the supposition that the deeper ones belong to
    main streams, and the shallower ones to tributaries. Such a valley as
    that shown at <i>e</i>, <a href="#fig155"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 155</a>, suggests rejuvenation at this point;
    but farther up the stream which occupies this valley, rejuvenation
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>might not be apparent. In this case, the main streams might be
    flowing in new valleys, <i>d, d′</i>, etc., while the heads of their
    tributaries are still flowing in the older valleys of the preceding
    cycle (compare <a href="#fig154"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 154</a> and <a href="#plate_XIIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XIII</a>).</p>

  <p>It is by the application of the preceding principles that it is known
    that the Appalachian Mountains, after being folded, were reduced to a
    peneplain (<a href="#Page_76"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 76</a>), throughout their whole extent from the Hudson River
    to Alabama. The peneplain level is indicated by the level crests of
    the Appalachian ridges, shown in cross profile by the high points of
    <a href="#fig157"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 157</a>. The system was then uplifted, and in the cycle of erosion
    which followed, broad plains were developed at a new and lower level,
    corresponding in a general way to the plains <i>b</i>, <i>b′</i>, and
    <i>b″</i> of <a href="#fig155"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 155</a>. The plains were located, for the most part,
    where the less resistant strata come to the surface. Above them rose
    even-crested ridges, the outcrops of the resistant layers, which
    had been isolated by the degradation of the softer beds between.
    They constitute the present mountain ridges (the high points of <a href="#fig157"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    157</a>). The evenness of their crests, testifying to the completeness
    of the first peneplanation, is shown in <a href="#fig158"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 158</a>, which represents,
    diagrammatically, a longitudinal profile of an Appalachian Mountain
    ridge. The evenness of the crest is interrupted by (1) notches (<i>b,
    c</i>, etc., <a href="#fig158"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 158</a>) cut by the streams in later cycles, and (2)
    by occasional elevations above the common level (monadnocks, <i>a,
    a′</i>, <a href="#fig158"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 158</a>). The monadnocks are generally rather inconspicuous,
    but there is a notable group of them in North Carolina and Tennessee.
    Mount Mitchell and Roane Mountain are examples. When long distances
    are considered, the ridge crests depart somewhat from horizontality.
    This is believed to be due, in part at least, to deformations of the
    old peneplain during the uplift which inaugurated the second cycle of
    erosion.</p>

  <p>The extent to which the second cycle of erosion recorded in the
    present topography had proceeded before its interruption by uplift,
    is indicated by the extent of the valley plains (<a href="#fig157"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 157</a>) below the
    mountain ridges. While these plains were being developed on the weak
    rocks, narrow valleys only (<a href="#fig158"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 158</a>) were cut in the resistant rocks
    which now stood out as ridges. In <a href="#fig158"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 158</a> some of these valleys are
    shallow (<i>c, c′, c″</i>, etc.), and but one of them deep. The former
    may be either (1) the valleys of streams which crossed the hard layer
    at the beginning of the cycle, and which were diverted before their
    valleys became deep; or (2) they may represent the heads of valleys now
    working back into the ridges. The deep valley (<i>b</i>) represents the
    work of a stream which has held its course across the hard layer while
    the latter was being isolated as a mountain ridge (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig131">131</a>
    and <a href="#fig131">132</a>). Deep narrows of this sort are often called <i>water-gaps</i>.
    Similar valleys, whether shallow or deep, from which drainage has been
    diverted, are sometimes called <i>wind-gaps</i>. The second cycle of
    erosion, while still far from complete, was interrupted by uplift
    (relative or absolute), and a new cycle inaugurated. This event was so
    recent that the new (third) cycle has not yet advanced far.</p>

  <p>The oldest erosion plain of the Appalachian Mountains, the results of
    which are seen in the even-crested ridges so characteristic of the
    system, is sometimes called the <i>Kittatinny base-level</i>.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It
    was completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> early in the Cretaceous period, and hence is sometimes
    known as the <i>Cretaceous base-level</i>. The next lower plain,
    imperfectly developed, has been called the Shenandoah Plain,<a id="FNanchor_62a" href="#Footnote_62a" class="fnanchor">[62a]</a>
    from the Shenandoah Valley where it is well seen (<a href="#fig131"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 132</a> and <a href="#plate_XIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XII</a>). It is to be noted that the terms <i>base-level</i> and
    <i>peneplain</i> have both been used in connection with these old
    plains. <i>Graded plain</i> is equally applicable. The truth is that
    the topographic types represented by these three terms grade into one
    another. It may be questioned whether definitions should be insisted on
    which differentiate these types more sharply than Nature has.</p>

  <p>Many of the peculiarities of the drainage of the Appalachian Mountain
    system are intimately connected with the history just outlined. Thus
    three great rivers, the Delaware, the Susquehanna, and the Potomac,
    have their sources west of the Appalachians proper, cross the system
    in apparent disregard of the structure, and flow into the Atlantic.
    The James and Roanoke head far to the west, although not beyond the
    mountain system, and flow eastward, while the New River (leading to
    the Kanawha) farther south, heads east of the mountain-folds, and
    flows northwestward across the alternating hard and soft beds of the
    whole Appalachian system, to the Ohio (<a href="#fig160"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 160</a>). The French Broad,
    a tributary to the Tennessee, has a similar course. Such streams are
    clearly not in structural adjustment, and afford good opportunities
    for piracy. Their courses were apparently assumed during the time of
    the Kittatinny base-level, when the streams had so low a gradient as
    not to be affected by the structure (<a href="#Page_150"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 150</a>). Elevation rejuvenated
    them, and they have held their courses in succeeding cycles across beds
    of unequal resistance, though smaller streams have become somewhat
    thoroughly adjusted. Crustal deformations have also helped them to hold
    their courses, for the Cretaceous peneplain seems to have been tilted
    to the southeast at its northern end, and to the southwest at its
    southern, when the succeeding cycle began.</p>

  <p>Streams which hold their early courses in spite of changes which
    have taken place since their courses were assumed are said to be
    <i>antecedent</i>. They antedate the crustal movements which, but
    for pre-existent streams, would have given origin to a different
    arrangement of river courses. As a result of crustal movements,
    therefore, a consequent stream may become antecedent. Master streams
    are more <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>likely to hold their courses, and therefore to become
    antecedent, than subordinate ones.</p>

  <p>The uplift of base-leveled beds, especially if the beds are tilted so
    as to bring layers of unequal resistance to the surface at frequent
    intervals, affords conditions favorable for extensive adjustment. The
    numerous wind-gaps in the mountain ridges, representing the abandoned
    courses of minor streams, and the less numerous water-gaps, which
    indicate the resistance of large streams to structural adjustment, are
    instructive witnesses of the extent to which adjustment has gone. So
    extensive has been the adjustment among the streams of the Appalachian
    Mountains that there is probably no considerable stream in the whole
    system which has not gained or lost through its own or its neighbors’
    piracy. The history of the rivers of the Appalachian Mountains has been
    further complicated by a considerable amount of warping during the
    periods of uplift.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

  <p><b>Sinking.—</b>The land on which a river system is developed may be
    depressed relative to sea-level. In this case the sea would occupy
    the lower ends of valleys, converting them into bays and estuaries.
    A stream in this condition is said to be <i>drowned</i>. Of drowned
    rivers there are many examples along the Atlantic coast. Thus the St.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>Lawrence River is drowned up to Montreal, and the Hudson up to Albany.
    If the drowned portion of the latter valley were not so narrow, it
    would be a bay. Delaware and Chesapeake Bays, as well as many smaller
    ones, both north and south, are likewise the drowned ends of river
    valleys (see figures, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>). If all parts of a drainage basin
    sank equally, the velocities of the streams above the limit of drowning
    would not be changed, for the gradients would remain the same as
    before. The fact that a river’s channel is below sea-level is not to
    be taken as proof that the valley is drowned. Thus the bottom of the
    channel of the Mississippi is as much as 100 feet below the level of
    the Gulf, some 20 miles above New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

  <p><b>Differential movement. Warping.—</b>Where a land surface on which
    a river system is established suffers warping, some parts going up
    and others down, the opposite movements being either absolute or
    relative, various phenomena would result. This may be illustrated by
    the accompanying diagrams (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig161">161</a> and <a href="#fig161">162</a>), where the profiles of
    the streams are represented as warped from the positions represented
    by the dotted lines, to the positions shown by the full lines. The
    velocity will be accelerated below the points of differential elevation
    (between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig161"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 161</a>, and between <i>a</i> and
    <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, <a href="#fig161"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 162</a>), but checked above
    (above <i>a</i>, and between <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, <a href="#fig161"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 162</a>). Above an
    elevation which notably checks its flow, a stream is <i>ponded</i>. If
    the ponding is slight, a marsh may develop above the obstruction; if
    more considerable, a lake is formed. Lakes of this class are likely to
    be short-lived, since the ponded waters are likely to soon overflow and
    lower their outlet so as to drain the lake. The elevation which ponds
    the stream may be great enough and rapid enough so that the resulting
    lake finds an outlet by some course other than that originally followed
    by the stream. Where a stream holds its course across an uplift athwart
    its valley, either with or without ponding, it becomes an antecedent
    stream (see <a href="#Page_169"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 169</a>), since it has a course assumed before the latest
    deformation of the crust and in apparent disregard of present surface
    configuration. Thus the Columbia River holds <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>its antecedent course
    across areas which have been uplifted (differentially) hundreds and
    even thousands of feet.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Some of the striking scenic features of
    this noble valley are the result of these changes in the country
    through which it flows. A lesser stream would have been <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>diverted, as
    many of its tributaries have been. Even its course across the Cascade
    ranges is believed to be antecedent.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

  <p>Another peculiarity of valleys and streams resulting from changes of
    level is illustrated in <a href="#plate_XIVb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XIV</a> (southern California). The
    main valleys of this part of the coast were developed when the land
    stood considerably higher than now. Later the subsidence of the coast
    converted the lower ends of the valleys into bays or fiords. The bays
    were then transformed into lagoons by deposition. Subsequent rise of
    the land or depression of the sea allowed the drainage from the old
    lagoons to cut across the deposits which had converted the bays into
    lagoons. The result is an old, wide valley above, suggested by a young
    one below.</p>

  <p>If the warpings were considerable, much more decisive changes in
    drainage would result. Suppose the drainage of a given region to be
    represented by the streams in <a href="#fig163"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 163</a>. If there is uplift along the
    axis 1–2, that part of <i>ac</i> above the axis of uplift would be
    ponded, or at least have its velocity checked, while the flow of some
    of the tributaries of <i>d</i> would be accelerated, and might work
    back and capture the other stream (<a href="#fig163"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 164</a>).</p>

  <p>Crustal warping was one of the conditions under which the Tennessee
    achieved its present anomalous course, and its history<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> is
    illustrative of the complex changes which drainage suffers when
    warping affects the area where the rock structures are of unequal
    resistance. At the close of the Cretaceous cycle of erosion, when the
    Appalachian Mountains had been reduced to a peneplain, the waters
    falling in the area now drained by the upper course of the Tennessee
    flowed south-south-west to the Gulf in a stream (the Appalachian River,
    <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig165"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 165</a>) the lower part of which had the general position of
    the Coosa and the Alabama.</p>

  <p>To the west of the Appalachian River, shorter streams flowed west and
    southwest into the Mississippi embayment (<a href="#fig165"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 165</a>) by courses which
    are not now definitely known. The succeeding cycle of erosion was
    inaugurated by uplift and deformation of the peneplain. The axis <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>of
    greatest elevation (<i>AB</i>, <a href="#fig166"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 166</a>) was nearly parallel to the
    Appalachian River, and the effect of the differential uplift was to
    impose a greater task on this river (<i>a</i>, <a href="#fig166"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 166</a>), which flowed
    along the axis of uplift, than upon the rivers which flowed westward
    and southwestward to the Mississippi embayment. The result was that
    the strongest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> southwesterly flowing streams worked its head
    back into the drainage basin of the Appalachian River, and captured,
    one by one, the head-waters of its westerly tributaries, establishing
    some such drainage relations as are shown in <a href="#fig166"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 166</a>. Still later,
    after the land area of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>the region had been considerably extended by
    the withdrawal of the sea, the Appalachian River itself was reached by
    the invading stream, and its waters carried away to the Mississippi Bay
    by a course the lower part of which is thought to have corresponded
    approximately with the course of the present Black River (<i>b</i>,

  <p>Still later there was further deformation which caused additional
    changes in the drainage. The whole region was uplifted, relatively
    if not absolutely, but the uplift was differential, being greatest
    along the axis represented by <i>AB</i>, <a href="#fig167"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 167</a>. The effect of the
    deformation was to stimulate the tributaries of the Ohio flowing north
    from this axis. Their growth was further accelerated by the weakness
    of the strata over which they ran. At the same time, the uplift to the
    south led the southwesterly flowing stream (<i>b</i>, <a href="#fig167"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 167</a>) to
    discover relatively hard beds of rock in its lower course, and these
    beds retarded its down-cutting. The result was that a tributary of the
    Ohio (<i>a</i>, <a href="#fig167"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 167</a>) finally tapped the main stream flowing to the
    southwest (<i>b</i>, <a href="#fig167"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 167</a>) and carried its upper part over to the
    Ohio (<a href="#fig168"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 168</a>). This was the beginning of the present Tennessee.</p>

  <h3>THE AGGRADATIONAL WORK OF RUNNING WATER.</h3>

  <p><b>Principles involved.—</b>Since deposition results from the failure
    of transportation, the factors which control transportation also
    influence deposition. Transportation by streams is determined largely
    by velocity, and the most important factors influencing velocity are
    slope, volume, and load (<a href="#Page_115"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 115</a>). Of these the first two are usually of
    greater importance than the third.</p>

  <p>A stream is said to be loaded when it has all the sediment it can
    carry; it is loaded with fine material when it has all the fine
    material it can carry, and with coarse material when it has all the
    coarse it can transport. A stream loaded with coarse material flows
    more swiftly than one loaded with fine, for a larger percentage of a
    stream’s energy can be utilized in carrying fine material than coarse,
    and hence a larger percentage of the energy of a stream which carries a
    load of the latter will express itself in velocity.</p>

  <p>Deposition takes place whenever a stream finds itself with more load
    than it can carry, and is an expression of the stream’s refusal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> to
    remain overloaded. A stream may become overloaded in various ways.
    It might at first seem unnecessary to inquire whether a stream may
    be overloaded at its source, but the question is not necessarily to
    be answered in the negative. The source of a stream is not always a
    definite point. In a general way it may be said that the source of the
    normal stream is at that point in its valley where the bottom is as low
    as the ground-water level of the region. But since the ground-water
    level is not constant (<a href="#Page_71"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 71</a>) the source of a stream is likely to be
    farther up its valley in a wet season than in a dry one (<a href="#Page_72"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 72</a>). After
    a heavy shower, the run-off descends to the axis of the valley from the
    slopes on all sides, and temporarily the stream begins above the point
    which marks even its wet-season source. If under such circumstances
    the slopes about the head of the valley are notably steeper than the
    slope of the valley itself, as they frequently are, the water flowing
    down them may gather an amount of material which it cannot carry after
    it reaches the bottom of the valley. This may be the case at, or even
    above, the point which marks the source of the permanent stream. It is,
    therefore, possible for a stream to be overloaded at its source, if we
    take the source to be the point whence the water permanently flows.
    Deposition may, therefore, be taking place in a valley at the head of
    its permanent stream, or temporarily even in the valley above it.</p>

  <p>Streams issuing from glaciers sometimes have more load than they can
    carry after they escape from the ice. If the stream be regarded as
    beginning at the point where it issues from beneath the ice it may be
    overloaded at its source.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

  <p>Under certain circumstances, a stream may overload itself. Thus if a
    stream loaded with coarse detritus reaches a portion of its valley
    where fine material is accessible in abundance, some of the velocity
    which is helping to carry the coarse may be used in picking up and
    carrying the fine. This reduces the velocity, and since the stream
    already had all the coarse material it could carry, reduction of
    velocity must result in deposition. It follows that when a stream fully
    loaded <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>with coarse material picks up fine, it becomes overloaded,
    <i>so far as the coarse material is concerned</i>.</p>

  <p>Again, tributaries may overload their mains. While tributaries
    are usually smaller than their mains, they frequently have higher
    gradients, and the smaller stream of higher gradient may bring to the
    larger stream of lower gradient more material than the latter can
    carry away. Thus deposition may take place at the point of junction of
    tributaries with their mains. This may go so far as to pond the latter
    enough to cause its expansion into a river-lake. Lake Pepin, in the
    Mississippi River at the mouth of the Chippewa (in <abbr title="Wisconsin">Wis.</abbr>), is an example.</p>

  <p>Streams may become overloaded by losing velocity or volume, or both.
    Decrease in velocity is brought about either by decrease in declivity
    or in volume. In general, streams have lower gradients and greater
    volumes in their lower courses than in their upper, and these two
    elements affect velocity in different ways. If the increase in volume
    be not enough to counterbalance the decrease in declivity, as is often
    the case, a stream which is loaded in its upper course will deposit
    in its lower. The decrease of velocity at the debouchure of a stream
    almost always leads to deposition.</p>

  <p>Decrease in velocity as the result of decrease in volume is less
    common. When decrease in volume occurs, it may be the result of (1)
    evaporation, (2) the absorption of water into the bed of the stream,
    or (3) branching—the giving off of <i>distributaries</i>. While
    evaporation is going on everywhere, the diminution of a stream by this
    means is usually more than balanced by the increase from tributaries,
    rainfall, and springs; but in arid regions a very different condition
    of things sometimes exists. If mountains in an arid region be capped
    with snow, its melting supplies the streams during the melting season.
    As the streams flow out from the mountains through dry regions, they
    receive little or no increment from rainfall, tributaries, or springs,
    and evaporation reduces the volume of water, or even dissipates it
    altogether. Absorption of water into the bed of the stream often
    accompanies evaporation. Reduction of volume by evaporation and by
    absorption is especially common in arid regions. Wherever loaded
    streams are reduced in volume, whether by evaporation or absorption,
    deposition takes place.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

  <p>The third way by which velocity is decreased as the result of
    decreasing volume is illustrated at the debouchures of many streams.
    Near the Gulf, for example, the Mississippi branches repeatedly (see
    <a href="#fig190"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 190</a>). The same phenomena are often seen where one stream joins
    another (<a href="#fig169"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 169</a>). Individually the distributaries are much smaller
    than the main stream before they separated from it, and because they
    are smaller their combined surfaces are greater, and the amount of
    energy consumed in the friction of flow is increased. The velocity of
    the water and its carrying power are, therefore, reduced. Thus the
    branching of streams gives rise to deposition, and where deposition
    takes place the gradient of the stream is reduced, and this occasions
    still further deposition. The sediment which fills up the channel and
    checks the flow finally compels the stream, or some part of it, to
    transgress its banks. Deposition, therefore, favors the development of
    distributaries, and the development of distributaries in turn favors
    deposition.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The foregoing statements make it clear that a stream may be eroding
    in one part of its valley while it is depositing in another, and that
    erosion may alternate with deposition in the same place, on account of
    fluctuations in volume, and, therefore, in velocity of the stream. It
    will be seen in the sequel that erosion and deposition may be taking
    place at the same time in the same part of the valley. The activities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
    of a river are so nicely balanced that slight disturbance at one point
    causes disturbance at all points below.</p>

  <h4><i>The deposits.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Types.—</b>Turning from the principles which underlie river
    deposition to the deposits themselves, they are found to occur in
    various situations. Running water usually descends from steeper slopes
    above to gentler slopes below, and ends at the sea, or in a lake or
    inland basin. Wherever there is a sudden decrease in its gradient, as
    at the base of a hill, ridge, or mountain, running water is likely to
    leave a large part of its load, building an <i>alluvial fan</i> or
    <i>cone</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig067">67</a>, <a href="#fig068">68</a>, and <a href="#plate_VI"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> VI</a>). Even where there is no sudden
    decrease in the gradient of a stream, there is likely to be a gradual
    one, and in spite of the fact that the increased volume of a stream in
    its lower course tends to overcome the effect of diminished gradient
    on velocity, deposition is likely to take place as the gradient is
    reduced. Deposits occasioned by the gradual reduction of a stream’s
    velocity often have great extent in the direction of a stream’s flow.
    They cover the flood plains of streams, making them <i>alluvial
    plains</i> (<a href="#fig073"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 73</a>). When a stream reaches the sea or a lake its
    current is destroyed and its load dropped, unless taken in charge by
    the waves and currents of the standing water. Sediment accumulated in
    quantity at the debouchures of streams gives rise to <i>deltas</i>
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig169">169</a>, <a href="#fig187">187</a>). Alluvial cones and fans, alluvial plains, and
    deltas, are the principal types of river deposits. Apart from these
    well-defined types there are <i>bars</i> in the channels of depositing
    streams, and much ill-defined alluvium which does not allow of ready
    classification.</p>

  <p><b>Alluvial fans and cones.—</b>The only distinction between the
    alluvial fan and the alluvial cone is one of slope, the cones (they are
    but half-cones at best) being steeper than the fans. Alluvial fans and
    cones have their most striking development where temporary torrents,
    occasioned by showers or the rapid melting of snow, issue from mountain
    ravines. Such streams usually carry heavy loads of detritus, the
    coarser part of which is likely to be deposited at the base of the
    mountain slope. Cones and fans built by such streams have a periodic
    rather than a steady growth.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of its development the material of the alluvial cone
    is deposited much as in a talus cone (compare <a href="#fig170"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 170</a> with <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig067">67</a>
    and <a href="#fig068">68</a>). Its deposition chokes the channel of the stream, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> some of
    the water then seeks new courses to right and left of the apex of the
    deposit. This expands the area of deposition to right and left, while
    the water which flows over it lengthens it in the direction of flow.</p>

  <p>The course and behavior of the water after reaching an alluvial cone is
    instructive. As its velocity is checked, deposition often takes place
    in the channel, diminishing its capacity. As the channel is filled up,
    the water tends to overflow on either side. The overflowing water,
    being shallow, has so little velocity that much of its load is dropped
    on either margin of the channel, building up levees. The water ever and
    anon breaks through the levees, giving rise to distributary streams,
    each of which aggrades its channel and builds its own miniature
    levees (<a href="#fig171"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 171</a>). Not rarely this process of channel-filling and
    levee-building goes on until the channels of the little rivulets are
    above the general level of the cone on which they rest. The rivulet
    then runs in a groove on the crest of a little ridge. The channels on
    the surfaces of fans and cones are fewest and deepest at their heads,
    and more numerous and shallower below. In some cases the surface-water
    disappears altogether before the outer border of the fan is reached, by
    sinking into the débris.</p>

    The talus cone reaches the sea-level. Drawn from photograph.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Alluvial fans and cones have various forms, and often attain
    considerable dimensions. Their angles of slope depend on the amount
    of reduction of velocity which the depositing water suffers, and the
    amount and kind of load which it carries. The maximum slope of the
    cone is the angle at which the loose material involved will lie. The
    minimum slope of the fan, on the other hand, approaches horizontality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
    If many alluvial fans develop in proximity to one another, as at the
    base of a mountain range, they may expand laterally until they merge. A
    long succession of them may thus give rise to an extensive <i>alluvial
    piedmont plain</i>, or a <i>compound alluvial fan</i>. The lower edge
    of such a fan is often somewhat lobate. Such plains exist along the
    bases of many mountain ranges (<a href="#plate_VI"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> VI</a>), and may be seen in miniature
    even along low ridges.</p>

  <p>A permanent stream, as well as a temporary one, may develop an alluvial
    fan at the base of a mountain slope; but since the mountain course of
    the former is likely to be less steep than that of the latter, its
    waters suffer a correspondingly less reduction of velocity at any
    one point. The fan of the permanent stream is therefore likely to be
    relatively flat, and to stretch far down the valley. Such fans grade
    into valley plains. From the general principles already discussed, it
    is clear that well-developed fans go with relatively youthful stages of
    erosion, and belong normally to the upper parts of drainage lines.</p>

  <p><b>Ill-defined alluvium.—</b>There is a widespread mantle of alluvial
    material deposited by running water which was not organized into
    distinct streams. The water which runs down smooth slopes in sheets
    during showers carries fine earthy matter, as well as some that
    is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> coarser. These materials are largely deposited at the bases of
    the slopes, forming basal accumulations of greater or less extent,
    comparable in origin to alluvial fans. A relatively small amount of the
    slope wash is carried far out from the base of the declivities. It is
    not easy to realize the extent to which this process is taking place.
    There is hardly a slope without loose material, and there is hardly an
    acre of low land below a slope on which running water has not deposited
    sediment washed down from above. When it is remembered that this is
    as true of gentle slopes and their surroundings as of steep slopes,
    though perhaps not to the same extent, and that a very large part of
    the earth’s surface is made up of sensible slopes, or of flats at their
    bases, some idea of the aggregate effect may be gained.</p>

  <p>There is another way of looking at the same question. Earthy matter
    is being continually transferred from land to sea, and chiefly from
    high land. Rarely does it start from any point distant from the shore
    and move uninterruptedly to it. It is transported a short distance and
    lodged, to be again picked up, carried forward another step in its
    journey, and lodged again. For a very large part of the earth’s surface
    it would be true to say that its mantle rock is material in transit
    from higher land to the sea.</p>

  <p><b>Alluvial plains.—</b>Most streams, whether heading in mountains or
    not, have gentler gradients in their lower courses than in their upper,
    and in spite of increasing volume are usually unable to carry to their
    debouchures all the material gathered above. The excess of load is
    dropped chiefly on the flood-plains of the streams and constitutes them
    <i>alluvial plains</i>.</p>

  <p>The making of an alluvial plain usually involves both erosion and
    deposition. When a stream has cut its channel to grade, downward
    erosion ceases, or more exactly, downward cutting is, on the average,
    counterbalanced by deposition. So long as a stream is cutting downward
    rapidly, it carries away whatever débris descends the side slopes. When
    it approaches grade, the débris which descends the side slopes tends to
    accumulate at their bases, and the V-shaped cross-section of the valley
    becomes U-shaped (see <a href="#fig172"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 172</a>). At about the same time the stream
    begins to meander, for, having lost something of its former velocity,
    it is more easily turned from side to side. As it begins to meander,
    it widens the bottom of its valley. This is the initial stage in the
    development of the valley flat (2 and 3, <a href="#fig172"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 172</a>). In its meandering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
    the stream encroaches on the talus accumulations at the bases of its
    valley’s slopes. The side-cutting may remove all the loose débris
    and even undercut the bluff as at <i>a</i>, <a href="#fig173"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 173</a>. The stream’s
    meanders shift their positions from time to time so that the valley
    flat is successively widened at different points. By lateral planation,
    therefore, a stream tends to develop a flat as soon as it reaches
    grade. This is the initial part of erosion in the making of a river
    flat, but a flat developed by erosion alone is not an alluvial plain.</p>

  <p>So soon as the flat developed by a stream exceeds the width of its
    channel, the water (except in times of flood) does not cover it all at
    the same time. On any part which it temporarily abandons, some débris
    (alluvium) is likely to be left. This deposit of alluvium constitutes
    the valley flat an alluvial plain (<a href="#fig174"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 174</a>). It will be seen that the
    valley flat is commonly an alluvial plain from the beginning.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Once the valley flat and alluvial plain are begun, their further
    development is easily followed. The stream in flood overflows the banks
    of its channel. The velocity of the overflowing water is reduced,
    and if it has much load a part of it will be dropped and the plain
    aggraded. Meantime meandering and lateral planation continue. Thus the
    flood-plain is widened by erosion, and aggraded by alluviation, the two
    processes going on simultaneously.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

  <p>Flood-plains, chiefly the result of planation, but partly of
    aggradation, are a normal feature of river valleys, after a certain
    stage of development has been reached. This stage is that at which
    downward erosion becomes slight in comparison with lateral erosion. It
    follows that an alluvial plain normally begins its development where
    the valley is first brought to grade, that is, in its lower course.
    As the development of the valley goes on, the head of the flood-plain
    advances up-stream, and at the same time its older parts become wider.</p>

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 175.—Diagrammatic representation of a
    flood plain developed by alluviation only.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Flood-plains due to alluviation only.—</b>Exceptionally, an alluvial
    plain is developed by deposition only. Thus if a stream becomes
    overloaded while its valley is still narrow, as sometimes happens,
    deposition follows, and, as aggradation proceeds, the narrow valley
    acquires a progressively wider bottom (<a href="#fig175"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 175</a>). Wide valley plains
    are sometimes developed in this way. Flood plains developed wholly by
    alluviation are sometimes formed under conditions which are independent
    of the stage of a valley’s development. Thus if a stream suddenly
    acquires an exceptional supply of detritus in its upper course, the
    development of an alluvial plain begins immediately below the point of
    overloading.</p>

  <p>The overload might be acquired in various ways. (1) If a stream taps
    another (piracy) which carries a large quantity of sediment, carrying
    off both water and sediment to a channel with a lower gradient,
    deposition may take place where, under the earlier conditions, there
    was none. (2) Again, when a stream cuts through a barrier near its
    head waters, its velocity, and, therefore, its eroding power, may be
    so increased in its upper course that sediment enough is acquired
    to occasion deposition below, where none took place before. (3) In
    working back through formations of varying degrees of resistance, a
    stream’s head may presently reach a formation or a region which yields
    abundant sediment, even though there was no especial barrier below.
    (4) If an advancing glacier should reach the head waters of a stream,
    its discharge to the stream would greatly increase the load of the
    latter, and, although its volume would be augmented at the same time,
    deposition might result. As a matter of fact, streams carrying glacial
    drainage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> are usually aggrading streams. In general, anything which
    greatly increases the load of a stream near its head is likely to cause
    deposition, and so the development of a flood plain, at some point
    farther down the valley.</p>

  <p>Streams which are actively aggrading their valleys are likely to

    channels until they are too small to accommodate all the water. The
    latter then breaks out of the channel at few or many points. The new
    channels thus established suffer the same fate.</p>

  <p><b>Flood-plains due to obstructions.—</b>Again, any obstacle in a
    stream’s course is likely to cause deposition above. Thus dams built
    across rivers entail the deposition of sediment above. Where a stream
    flows over the outcropping edges of strata of different strength, the
    more resistant serve, in some sense, as dams. Above them the stream
    cuts its bed to a low gradient, and, becoming sluggish, drops more or
    less of the detritus brought down from above. Obstacles of any sort
    across a stream’s channel, therefore, favor the development of alluvial
    plains.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Levees.—</b>As the stream in flood escapes its channel and
    overspreads its plain, its immediate banks are the site of active
    deposition, for it is here that the velocity of the overflowing water
    is first notably checked. On the banks of the channel, therefore, low
    alluvial ridges, called <i>natural levees</i>, are built up (<a href="#fig178"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    178</a>, and <a href="#plate_XV"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XV</a>). They may be narrow, or hundreds of feet in width,
    and are often several feet above the plains behind them, giving the
    latter a slope away from the channel of the stream. They are sometimes
    high enough to control the courses of tributary streams, as shown by
    numerous tributaries to the Mississippi below the Ohio. The Yazoo, for
    example, flows some 200 miles on the flood-plain of the Mississippi
    before it joins that river near Vicksburg. The levees even become
    divides, directing drainage away from the streams they guard <a href="#plate_XV">(<abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr>
    XV</a>). Streams sometimes build levees faster than their tributaries
    aggrade their channels. The latter are then ponded, giving rise to
    lakes. The lakes on the lower courses of the tributaries to the Red
    River of Louisiana are examples.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> They are sometimes built up
    above their natural level and kept in repair by human agency so as
    to confine the streams in time of flood. This is a source of danger
    unless they be steadily maintained, for the breaking of such levees
    often occasions great destruction. A case in point is the breaking
    of the levees of the Mississippi near New Orleans in 1890. The water
    broke through the levees at the Nita and Martinez crevasses (<a href="#fig187"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 187</a>)
    and flowed eastward (from the former) with a current of 15 miles per
    hour, spreading destruction in its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>path. The water flowed eastward
    through Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne, and entered Mobile Bay with
    such volume, velocity, and load of mud, as to destroy for a time the
    oyster and fish industries of that locality.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

  <p><b>Flood-plain meanders. Cut-and-fill.—</b>A stream with an alluvial
    plain is likely to meander widely (<a href="#plate_XVI"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XVI</a>). In general terms this
    may be said to be the result of low velocity, which allows it to be
    easily turned aside. Were the course of such a stream made straight, it
    would soon become crooked again. The manner of change is illustrated
    by <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig180">180</a> and <a href="#fig181">181</a>. If the banks be less resistant at some points
    than at others, as is always the case, the stream will cut in at those
    points. If the configuration of the channel is such as to direct a
    current against a given point, <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig180"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 180</a>), the result is the
    same, even without inequality of material. Once a curve in the bank
    is started, it is increased by the current which is directed into it.
    Furthermore, as the current issues from the curve, it impinges against
    the opposite bank and develops a curve at that point. The water issuing
    from this curve develops another, and so on.</p>

  <p>Once started, the curves or meanders tend to become more and more
    pronounced (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig180">180</a> and <a href="#fig181">181</a>).
    In the case represented by <a href="#plate_XVIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    1, Plate XVI</a> (Missouri River near Brunswick, Mo.) the narrow neck of
    land between curves is almost cut through. When this is accomplished,
    the stream will abandon its wide curve. A later stage in the process is
    shown in <a href="#plate_XVIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, Plate XVI</a> (the Osage River near Schell, Mo.).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

  <p>The straightening of the channel is often accomplished in another way.
    Even before the meanders reach the stage represented by <a href="#plate_XVIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, Plate
    XVI</a>, the position of the channel becomes unstable. In time of flood,
    the whole flat is covered with flowing water. The greater depth of
    water in the channel tends to give it a velocity greater than that of
    the water on the flat outside. But the distance from <i>a</i> to <i>c
    via b</i> (<a href="#fig181"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 181</a>) is much greater than that in a direct line. It
    follows that the slope from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i> direct is greater than
    that by way of <i>b</i>. If the current between <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>
    in time of flood be strong enough to erode, it may deepen its bed,
    and thereby increase the volume of water following this course. The
    increased volume gives increased velocity, and the result may be the
    opening of a channel between <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> direct. The channel
    may be worn so deep that when the flood subsides, the stream will
    follow it. So long as the abandoned channel-curve remains unfilled with
    sediment, it is often called a <i>cut-off</i>. If it contains standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
    water and has the proper form, it is called an <i>ox-bow lake</i> (<a href="#fig182"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    182</a>), or sometimes a <i>bayou</i>. The water-filled portions are not
    always bows (<a href="#fig183"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 183</a>, Osage River, near Butler, Mo.). Cut-offs, with
    or without standing water, are of common occurrence along most rivers
    with wide plains. Meandering is not confined to streams which are near
    sea-level.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span> Even small creeks at high altitudes may meander, if so
    situated as to have slight velocity. Trout Creek in the Yellowstone
    Park (<a href="#fig184"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 184</a>) is an example.</p>

  <p>There seems to be some relation between the width of the belt within
    which a stream meanders, and the width of the stream itself. Recently
    it has been estimated that the ratio between them is 18:1.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

  <p>During the development of the meanders it is to be noted that lateral
    planation on the one side of a stream is accompanied by deposition
    on the other. This is <i>cut-and-fill</i>. The sediment eroded from
    the curve which is concave toward the stream is shifted down-stream,
    while that deposited in the curve which is convex toward the stream is
    brought down from above. Thus even in the development of meanders, the
    material which is dislodged is shifted down-stream. Since the current
    directed against the down-stream side of a growing meander is on the
    average stronger than that directed against the opposite side, the
    meander itself has a tendency to migrate down-stream (<a href="#fig182"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 182</a>).</p>

  <p>In their evolution, the curves of a stream’s channel often reach and
    undermine the valley bluff (<a href="#plate_VII"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> VII</a>). Since the meanders are, on the
    average, shifted down-stream individually, and since meanders are
    frequently developed in new places, it follows that a meandering stream
    tends to widen its valley throughout. Widening is also effected in
    other ways, for a stream with a flood-plain sometimes abandons its
    channel altogether for miles at a stretch, and the new course chosen
    may be against one of the bluffs of the valley. Such changes are most
    likely to take place where deposition along channel and levees has
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>brought the part of the flood-plain (though not necessarily the bottom
    of the channel) adjacent to the stream above the level of that farther
    from it (<a href="#fig178"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 178</a>). The change is likely to be effected in time of
    flood.</p>

  <p>Flood-plains often attain great size. That of the Mississippi below the
    Ohio (<a href="#fig179"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 179</a>) has a width ranging from rather more than 20 miles at
    Helena (<abbr title="Arkansas">Ark.</abbr>), to something like 80 miles in the latitude of Greenville
    (<abbr title="Mississippi">Miss.</abbr>).<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Below the Ohio its area is something like 30,000 square
    miles, and its entire area has been estimated at about 50,000 square
    miles.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

  <p>Theoretically, the rotation of the earth should affect the erosion
    of streams, increasing it on the one bank (the right in the northern
    hemisphere and the left in the southern) and decreasing it on the
    other.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The streams doubtless accommodate themselves to the rotation
    of the earth in the original development of their gradation-plains
    and flood-plains, and the later effects of rotation are usually
    inconspicuous.</p>

  <p><b>Scour-and-fill.—</b>It has already been shown that aggrading streams
    cut laterally at the same time that they build up their plains. It is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>now to be added that they periodically deepen their channels to a
    notable extent, and that the deepening of the channel takes place at
    the very time when the flood-plain is being aggraded. In other words,
    the stream in flood aggrades its plain, and degrades its channel.
    This follows from the fact that the current is sluggish in the former
    position, where the water is shallow, and rapid in the latter, where
    it is deep. When the flood subsides, the channel, deepened while
    the current was torrential, is filled again by the feebler current
    which follows. This alternate deepening and filling is known as
    scour-and-fill. It is well illustrated by the Missouri River. At
    Nebraska City, scour is believed to occasionally reach depths of 70
    to 90 feet.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> At Blair, about 25 miles above Omaha, the same river
    is believed to cut to bed-rock (about 40 feet below the bottom of the
    channel in low water) twice a year, that is, during floods.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> <a href="#fig185"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    185</a> shows the changes recorded in the channel of the river at this
    point during the year 1883. It shows that the scour-and-fill during
    this year amounted to almost 40 feet. All <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>streams similarly situated
    do a like work. The material thus eroded is shifted down-stream, some
    of it for short distances only, and some of it to the sea. Even an
    aggrading stream therefore is not without erosive activity; it is a
    stream whose fill exceeds its scour, not one which has ceased to erode.</p>

  <p><b>Materials of the flood-plain.—</b>As a result of its varying
    velocities in flood and low water, a stream may deposit coarse material
    at one time and fine at another. A similar sequence of deposits takes
    place in the flood-plain of a meandering stream, irrespective of
    floods. Flood-plain deposits are often therefore very heterogeneous, as
    shown in <a href="#fig186"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 186</a>, which represents the constitution of the alluvium of
    the Missouri River at Omaha. The deposits of the streams range from the
    finest clay, through sand to gravel, and even bowlders. In general they
    become finer down-stream. In a given plain, they are usually coarser
    below and finer above.</p>

    character of alluvial deposits. (Todd, <abbr title="Bulletin">Bull.</abbr> 158, <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Topography of the flood-plain.—</b>The flood-plain is nearly, but
    not altogether, flat. It has a gentle slope down-stream, and often for
    a distance from the sides toward the center (<a href="#fig174"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 174</a>). This latter
    slope is the result of deposition by waters descending to the plain
    from the sides. It is destroyed wherever a meandering stream reaches
    its bluffs. When levees are well developed, there is a slope from them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
    toward the sides of the valley (<a href="#fig178"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 178</a>), but it rarely continues
    to the limiting bluffs. Since a stream with a well-developed flat
    frequently shifts its course, old levees and abandoned channels lend
    variety to the topography of the flood-plain.</p>

  <p><b>The topographic adjustment of tributaries.</b><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>—The meandering
    and shifting of a main stream affects its tributaries. If a main stream
    swings against the bluff through which a tributary enters, the latter
    brings its channel into topographic adjustment by lowering its end to
    the level of the main. If now the main stream opposite the tributary
    swings to the other side of its valley, the tributary must make its
    way across the flat with a very low gradient. Not only this, but the
    flat of the main valley through which the tributary must flow is likely
    to be aggraded by the main in time of flood. The result is that the
    tributary stream becomes an aggrading stream at its debouchure, and
    topographic adjustment is not established until it has filled up the
    lower end of its valley to some notable extent. The filling of the
    lower end of the tributary likewise affects the lower ends of its lower
    tributaries.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 187.—A general view of the Mississippi
    delta.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If the main stream again swings over to the point where the tributary
    issues from its valley, the tributary stream and all its affected
    tributaries again become eroding streams. Thus scour-and-fill are not
    confined to the valley of the main stream.</p>

  <p><b>River-lakes.—</b>While rivers are in general hostile to lakes, they
    sometimes give origin to them. Oxbow lakes (<a href="#fig182"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 182</a> and <a href="#plate_XVI"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XVI</a>),
    due to the cut-offs of meandering streams, have already been referred
    to. Lakes formed in the same way have other forms (<a href="#plate_XVI"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XVI</a> and
    <a href="#fig183"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 183</a>). Rivers also give rise to lakes through the deposits they make.
    If a main stream obstructs its tributaries by deposition at their
    debouchures, their lower courses are ponded and converted into lakes.
    The lakes along the tributaries to the Red River of Louisiana have
    already been cited as examples. If a tributary brings more load to its
    main than the latter can carry away, the detritus constitutes a partial
    dam, ponding the river and causing it to expand into a lake above. Such
    is the origin of Lake Pepin already referred to. In mountain regions,
    the alluvial cones of tributary valleys sometimes pond their mains.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 188.—Longitudinal section of an incipient
    delta made of coarse material.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Rivers may be dammed in other ways, as by lava flows, by landslides, by
    glacial drift, etc. In all such cases, lakes may come into existence,
    but they are not due primarily to the activity of the river itself.</p>

  <p><b>Deltas.</b><a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>—Where a stream enters standing water, or a slower
    stream, a special form of plain, <i>the delta</i>, is sometimes built
    up (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig169">169</a>, <a href="#fig187">187</a>, and <a href="#fig188">188</a>). Deltas and alluvial fans have much in
    common, and their only notable differences are those imposed by the
    differences in the conditions of deposition. The current of the stream
    is checked, but not altogether stopped, at its immediate debouchure. If
    it carries abundant sediment, much of it will be promptly dropped where
    the decrease in velocity is first felt. Such flow as there is beyond
    the debouchure <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>is not confined to a definite channel, and the deposits
    made are therefore spread more or less on either side of the line which
    represents the continuation of the stream’s course.</p>

  <p>As the depth of the water into which the stream flows increases, the
    current diminishes. Out to the point where the depth of the standing
    water is less than the depth of the current, the latter affects the
    bottom, and the surface of the deposits made slopes gently seaward; but
    where the depth of the standing water is such that the projected stream
    current is ineffective at the bottom, all the load rolled along the
    bottom is dropped, and a depositional slope is established (<a href="#fig188"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 188</a>),
    its upper edge being below sea-level by an amount corresponding roughly
    to the depth of the current which brings the detritus. The outer slope
    is relatively steep and well-defined where the detritus is coarse, and
    relatively gentle and ill-defined where it is fine. Thus the stream
    tends to construct a sort of platform in the water just beyond its
    debouchure. The successive deposits on the outer abrupt slope will dip
    conformably with its surface (<a href="#fig189"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 189</a>). The finest sediment will be
    carried beyond the steep slope, and conform to the topography of the
    bottom beyond (<i>c</i>, <a href="#fig189"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 189</a>).</p>

  <p>At the beginning, the top of the delta platform is at the level of the
    bottom of the stream’s channel at the point of debouchure, but it is
    gradually aggraded as water continues to flow over it. Its landward
    margin is presently built up to sea-level and then above it, and as the
    delta grows the delta-land is extended seaward (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig188">188</a> and
    <a href="#fig189">189</a>). At the same time the channel of the stream above the original
    head of the delta is aggraded, for the current there is checked by the
    aggradation of the delta. Thus alluvial deposits continuous with the
    delta are extended landward.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig189">
    <img class="illowp92" src="images/fig189.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 189.—Longitudinal section of the delta at
    a later stage of development.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The projection of the direction of the lower end of the stream may be
    said to be the axis of the extra-debouchure current. From this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> axis,
    where the flow is strongest, the movement diverges more or less to
    right and left. Since the velocity of the diverging water is reduced
    more rapidly than that of the water which follows the axis of flow,
    deposition is likely to take place faster on either side of the axis
    than along the axis itself. The result is that the extra-debouchure
    current tends to build up levee-like ridges on either side, making a
    sort of sluice-way for itself. This sluice-way is gradually extended
    seaward, and at the same time gradually filled. As its capacity is
    reduced, more and more of the water flows over its sides. Presently
    the escape of the water over the little side-levees will develop a
    break at some point, and a line of distinct flow then diverges from the
    main current. This distributary repeats the history of its main. Thus
    the processes of levee-building, channel-filling, and levee-breaking
    follow one another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> until some such system of currents as shown in
    <a href="#fig190"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 190</a> is developed. The result is that a delta’s growth is not
    simply in the line of extension of the main stream, but in a more or
    less semicircular area, the center of the circle being a point slightly
    below the position of the debouchure of the stream when the delta
    began. At any stage in its development the margin of the delta is more
    or less crenate (<a href="#fig191"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 191</a>), or characterized by delta fingers (<a href="#fig190"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    190</a>), the projections corresponding to the positions of the debouchures
    of the latest streams flowing across it. The extreme ends of the
    delta lobes (<a href="#fig190"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 190</a>), and of groups of the delta fingers, often
    have something of the shape of the Greek letter from which the name
    originated, but the resemblance in form between a well-developed delta
    and the Greek letter is not striking. Deltas are sometimes built in
    bays, and in such cases their forms are predetermined on all sides but
    one. The head of a delta is sometimes arbitrarily located at the point
    where the first distributaries are given off. Since this point shifts
    widely with time, the definition can hardly be accepted. On this basis
    the head of the Mississippi delta is about 200 miles above its lower
    end. In reality it is much farther north.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The structure of a delta, shown in <a href="#fig189"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 189</a>, shows its history. At any
    stage in its growth the river discharges its sediment across that part
    of the platform already built. The sediment rolled at the bottom of
    the current is dumped on reaching the steep slope, and constitutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
    the inclined <i>fore-set</i> beds shown in <a href="#fig189"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 189</a>. The material in
    suspension is carried farther, settles more gradually, and constitutes
    the <i>bottom-set</i> beds (<i>c</i>, <a href="#fig189"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 189</a>). In time the bottom-set
    beds, originally deposited some distance beyond the debouchure, may
    come to be overlain by the fore-set beds, deposited at a later time.
    While the fore-set beds are being deposited on the steep slopes of the
    delta, and the bottom-set beds beyond, deposition is also taking place
    on the top of the delta. These <i>top-set</i> beds are laid down in
    a nearly horizontal position, and their seaward margin is gradually
    extended. Thus the delta comes to have the threefold structure shown in
    <a href="#fig189"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 189</a>.</p>

  <p>That part of the delta which is above the abrupt slope of its front
    corresponds in all essentials to an alluvial fan; but the delta as a
    whole differs from the fan in its abrupt and crenate or digitate margin.</p>

  <p>It is to be noted that the delta is not wholly the product of a
    stream’s activity. The stream supplies the material, but the lake
    or sea renders at least passive assistance in its disposition. Not
    all rivers opening into the sea build deltas, and their failure is
    often the result of waves or shore currents which carry off the river
    sediment. Deltas are, however, sometimes formed in tidal seas, as at
    the debouchures of the Yukon; the Mackenzie, where the tidal range is
    three feet; the Niger, where the range is four feet; the Hoang-Ho,
    where the range is eight feet; and the Brahmaputra and Ganges, where
    the range is sixteen feet.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Since lakes, bays, gulfs, and inland
    seas have weaker waves and currents than the open sea, they are more
    favorable than the latter for the growth of deltas. Hence occur such
    deltas as those of the Mississippi, the Nile, the Po, and the Danube.</p>

  <p>Deltas are likely to be absent, or confined to the heads of bays, on
    coasts which have recently sunk. Their general absence on the Atlantic
    coast of the United States is a case in point.</p>

  <p>The following figures give some idea of the extent of deltas, and of
    their importance in land building. The Mississippi delta is advancing
    into the Gulf at the rate of about 100 yards per year, or a mile in
    16 or 17 years. Its length is more than 200 miles, its area more than
    12,000 square miles, and its depth at New Orleans has been estimated
    at 700<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> to 1000<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> feet. This great depth is believed to be the
    result of subsidence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> and so of the superposition of one delta on
    another.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The delta of the Yukon has a sea margin of 70 miles,
    and extends more than 100 miles inland. The delta of the Rhône has
    also had a remarkable growth, considering the size and the history of
    the stream. Arles, near the debouchure of the stream, was 14 to 16
    miles inland in the fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and is now 30 miles
    inland.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The Rhône has also built a great delta in Lake Geneva,
    and its lower delta is built of sediment gathered below the lake. The
    Po has built a delta 14 miles beyond Adria, the port which gave its
    name to the Adriatic Sea. The extension of this delta has been at the
    average rate of about 50 feet per year, but recently, on account of
    artificial embankments, the rate has been much more rapid.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The
    Ganges and Brahmaputra together have made a delta of great size. Its
    area is sometimes estimated to be as high as 50,000 or 60,000 square
    miles, and its head is more than 200 miles from the sea.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The head
    of the Nile delta is 90 miles from the sea, and it has a coastal border
    of 180 miles. The head of the delta of the Hoang-Ho is about 300 miles
    from the coast, and its seaward border has a length of about 400 miles,
    though with some highland interruptions.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

  <p>After a delta has been built into a lake, the lake may disappear,
    leaving the delta out of water. Such “fossil” deltas, if so recently
    exposed that erosion has not destroyed their distinctive features,
    are readily recognized by their flat tops, their abrupt and lobate
    fronts, and their characteristic structure. They are often a means
    of determining the former existence of extinct lakes,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> or the
    former higher levels of lakes which still exist.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Elevated deltas
    on seashores show either a rise of the land or a depression of the
    sea-level.</p>

  <p>The material which is carried along the coasts or shores from the
    mouths of rivers may take on various and peculiar forms, according
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>to the strength, direction, and relations of waves and currents. The
    consideration of these forms belongs more properly to the work of the
    sea than to that of rivers, since rivers are not concerned in their
    construction except in supplying material.</p>

  <p><b>Delta lakes.—</b>Delta-building streams sometimes help to form lakes
    by throwing their deposits around an area which fails to be aggraded
    to sea-level. Lake Pontchartrain, and other lakes in the delta of the
    Mississippi are examples (<a href="#fig187"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 187</a>).</p>

  <h4>STREAM TERRACES.</h4>

  <p>Stream terraces<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> are bench-like flats or narrow plains along the
    sides of valleys (<a href="#fig192"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 192</a>). They are usually narrow, but sometimes
    have great length in the direction of the axis of the valley. They
    originate in various ways.</p>

  <p><b>Due to inequalities of hardness.—</b>Reference has already been made
    (<a href="#Page_140"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 140</a>) to the effect of hard horizontal layers in the development
    of terraces and terraciform projections on the sides of valleys (<a href="#fig120"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    120</a>). Such terraces are the result of differential degradation, and
    the upper <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>surface of the hard layer marks the lower limit of the
    terrace, which commonly has a distinct slope toward the stream. Except
    where interrupted by tributary valleys, such terraces are likely to
    be continuous in a valley so long as the structure remains the same
    and the stream sustains the same relation to it. Such terraces would
    first show themselves in the older part of the valley. The effect of
    inclination of the hard stratum on the development of such terraces
    will be readily inferred. Terraces and benches of this sort are not
    equally distinct at all stages of a valley’s history. For great
    distinctness, the hard layer should have been exposed long enough to
    allow the general processes of erosion to have effected considerable
    differential wear, but not long enough to allow the topographic effects
    of unequal resistance to be obliterated.</p>

    terrace and a “second bottom (<i>b</i>),” which may be regarded as a

  </figure>

  <p><b>Normal flood-plain terraces.—</b>It has been seen that deposition
    in a river valley stands in more or less definite relationship to
    the stage of its development, and that the deposition which leads to
    the development of an alluvial plain is likely to take place where
    the higher gradient of the upper course gives place to the gentler
    gradient of the lower. It has also been seen that as a stream’s history
    advances, the stretch where the gradient is high recedes up-stream,
    and that the point which marks the head of active deposition follows.
    It follows that a river flat or flood-plain normally begins in the
    lower part of a valley, and works progressively headward, its upper end
    following, at some considerable distance, the head of the valley itself.</p>

  <p>The commoner river terraces are remnants of former flood-plains,
    below which the streams which made them have cut their channels. It
    has already been pointed out (<a href="#Page_184"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 184</a>) that processes of erosion and
    deposition work together in the development of flood-plains, and that
    some flood-plains have but little alluvium (<a href="#fig174"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 174</a>), while others
    owe their origin wholly to stream deposits (<a href="#fig175"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 175</a>). It follows that
    terraces developed from flood-plains may be of rock, of alluvium, or of
    rock covered with alluvium.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

  <p>The amount which a river channel must be deepened in order to change
    the remnants of its flood-plain to terraces cannot be definitely
    stated. When a channel is so deep that the remnants of a former
    flood-plain are no longer flooded, they would be called terraces,
    especially if a lower flood-plain has been developed. Even though not
    above the reach of floods, they are often called terraces if they are
    notably above the channel and separated from it by a lower plain. Thus
    the flat at <i>b</i>, <a href="#fig193"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 193</a>, would be called a terrace, even though
    covered by water in exceptional floods; but the flat at <i>c</i>, but
    slightly above the channel, would hardly be called a terrace.</p>

    the development of a terrace from a flood-plain.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The question now arises why a stream, having once developed a
    flood-plain, should sink its channel to a lower level, leaving parts
    of the old flood-plain as terraces. This may be brought about by the
    operation of various causes.</p>

  <p>(1) In the first place, the head of the valley-plain where the first
    notable deposition takes place normally advances up-stream. After the
    advance has been considerable, the descending stream may, on reaching
    the head of its valley-plain, lose so much of its load as to be able
    to sink its channel into the flood-plain farther down the valley (<a href="#fig194"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    194</a>).</p>

  <p>(2) Ordinarily a stream does not drop all its load at the head of its
    plain, but only its excess; but it will always drop coarse sediment
    to take fine, if fine be available. For a relatively small amount of
    coarse material dropped, a relatively large amount of fine may be
    taken up (<a href="#Page_179"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 179</a>). Other things being equal, it follows that when a
    stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> drops coarse material to take fine, its channel is degraded
    unless there is at the same time a great reduction in the stream’s
    energy. Such reduction is likely to go with the decreasing declivity
    down-stream; but this is partly, or sometimes wholly, counterbalanced
    by the increasing volume of water. By the exchange of load, therefore,
    a stream may ultimately sink its channel below the flood-plain which
    the earlier and perhaps smaller stream had developed.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig195">

    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 195.—Diagram to illustrate the development
    of river terraces by the widening of a channel or meander belt. The
    valley flat above might not be called a terrace; but the same plain
    below, where the meander belt has some width, would be called a terrace.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>(3) Again, so long as a stream is actively eroding at its head, there
    is likely to be some aggradation below. At a later stage in the
    stream’s history, when active erosion at the head has ceased because
    of the reduction of the surface, less material will be carried from
    the upper part of the valley, and the stream on the flood-plain below,
    formerly loaded with material from up the valley, is now free to take
    up and carry away material temporarily left on the flood-plain. The
    result is a deepening of the channel.</p>

  <p>(4) Any stream which has reached the flood-plain stage is likely to
    meander. After the flood-plain has become wide, the width of the belt
    within which the stream meanders is less than the width of its plain.
    In the Lower Mississippi, for example, the meander belt is often no
    more than a third to a tenth of the width of the flood-plain. It has
    already been pointed out that the meanders migrate down the valley. In
    so doing they depress the meander belt, the tendency being to reduce
    it to the level of the channel, and, therefore, below the level of
    the flood-plain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> As the meander belt widens, the depression which it
    develops becomes more and more capacious. Presently it may attain such
    dimensions as to hold the water of ordinary floods. At this stage,
    or even before, such parts of the earlier flood-plain as remain, are
    terraces.</p>

  <p>These several tendencies conspire to partially destroy river
    flood-plains, and to transform such parts as remain into terraces <i>in
    the normal course of a river’s history</i>. They appear first in the
    lower part of the valley, and migrate headward, following the course
    of nearly every other phase of activity in a stream’s history. The
    heads of the terraces follow, at a respectful distance, the head of the
    flood-plain, just as the head of the flood-plain follows at a distance
    the head of the valley. The second and subsequent flood-plains and the
    terraces to which they give origin follow the same course.</p>

  <p>Terraces developed by the normal activities of a stream are always low,
    and it is improbable that they would ordinarily be conspicuous. The
    vertical distance between the first (highest) and second is greater
    than that between the second and third. The principles developed on
    page 65 et seq., in connection with the erosion of the hypothetical
    island, are applicable here.</p>

  <p><b>Flood-plain terraces due to other causes.—</b>Certain other causes,
    accidental rather than normal to a stream, result in the development of
    terraces from flood-plains. (1) If there be uplift in a region where
    the rivers have flats, the streams are rejuvenated, and the remnants
    of their former flood-plains become terraces. (2) If an alluvial
    flood-plain has been built as the result of an excessive supply of
    sediment (<a href="#Page_186"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 186</a>), the exhaustion or withdrawal of the excessive supply
    would leave the stream again relatively clear, and free to erode where
    it had been depositing. It would forthwith set to work to carry away
    the material which it had temporarily unloaded on the plain. The plains
    built up in many valleys in the northern part of our continent during
    the glacial period, when the drainage from the ice coursed through
    them, have subsequently been partially destroyed by erosion, and their
    remnants have become terraces. A notable reduction in the amount of
    available sediment, even when the earlier supply was not excessive,
    produces a similar result. (3) A notable increase in the volume of a
    stream, without corresponding increase in load, as when one stream
    captures another, may occasion the development of terraces by allowing
    the stream to deepen its channel. (4) Above any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> barrier which dams a
    stream, a flood-plain is likely to be developed. When the barrier is
    removed the stream will cut more or less deeply into the plain above,
    leaving terraces. (5) The recession of a falls through a flood-plain
    converts such parts of it as remain, into terraces.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, it may be stated that many river terraces, mostly
    very low, are normal features of valley development, coming into
    existence at definite stages in a valley’s history. They are generally
    composed, in large part, of river alluvium. Others result from more
    or less accidental causes, working singly or in conjunction, and to
    this class belong all of the more conspicuous terraces developed from
    flood-plains. The structure of a terrace often affords some clue to its
    origin (<a href="#fig196"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 196</a>).</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig196">
    <img class="illowp68" src="images/fig196.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 196.—Terraces partly of rock and partly
    of alluvium. Such terraces indicate successive uplifts, or some other
    change which had a similar effect on the stream which made the valley.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Discontinuity of terraces.—</b>When a stream sinks its channel
    into its flood-plain, it does not follow that a terrace remains on
    each side. Where the stream’s deepened channel is in the middle of
    its flood-plain, there is, temporarily, a terrace on either side; but
    wherever the deepened channel is at one margin of its flood-plain,
    a terrace remains on the other side only. Even where continuous at
    the outset, terraces soon become discontinuous, for all processes of
    subaërial erosion conspire to destroy them. A stream is likely to
    meander on its second and later flood-plains, as on its first and
    highest one. Wherever the meanders on its second flood-plain reach the
    borders of the first flood-plain, the terrace at that point disappears,
    and since the meanders are continually migrating, terraces are
    continually disappearing. The same would be true of the second terrace,
    if a second were developed. The removal of portions of a terrace by
    the sweep of meanders is likely to leave the remnants cuspate toward
    the stream.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Again, tributary streams, in bringing their channels
    into topographic adjustment with their mains, cut through the terraces
    of the latter. New gullies develop on the faces of the terraces and
    their heads work back across them, dissecting them still further. At
    the same time, sheet erosion and other phases of slope wash tend to
    drive the scarps of the terraces back <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>toward the bluff beyond. By the
    time a second series of terraces is well developed, no more than meagre
    remnants of the first may remain.</p>

  <p>From the foregoing considerations it is clear that the extent to which
    river terraces once developed, now remain, is dependent in part on the
    length of time which has elapsed since the river sank its channel below
    them. Other things being equal, the greater their age the more meagre
    their remnants.</p>

  <p>Terraces developed from river plains formed chiefly by alluviation
    stand a better chance of long life than most other alluvial terraces.
    This is because of the configuration of the original valley, the
    aggradation of which gave origin to the plain. The principle involved
    is illustrated by <a href="#fig197"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 197</a>. In developing the second flood-plain the
    river encounters the rock wall of the valley. This greatly retards
    lateral erosion, and the terrace above, <i>defended</i><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> by the
    rock, is likely to be long-lived.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig197">
    <img class="illowp58" src="images/fig197.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 197.—Diagram to show why certain terraces
    are longer lived than others.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Alluvial terraces, like rock shelves, are popularly thought to mark
    “old levels of the river.” In one sense this is true, but not in the
    sense in which the expression is commonly used. Every level, from the
    crest of the bounding bluffs to the bottom of a valley, is a level at
    which water ran for a longer or shorter time; but the terrace does not
    mean that the river was once so much larger than now as to fill the
    valley from its present channel to the level of the terraces.</p>

  <p><b>Termini of terraces.—</b>From the mode of development of terraces it
    will be seen that, traced up-stream, each terrace should theoretically
    grade into a flood-plain at its upper end (<a href="#fig194"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 194</a>), and that the
    upper end of the second (from the top) terrace, where there are two,
    would not be so far up-stream as the upper end of the first (highest).
    This is represented diagrammatically in <a href="#fig198"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 198</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

  <p>The down-stream termini of terraces are rarely distinct. This is partly
    because the notable meandering of the streams in their lower courses
    is antagonistic to the preservation of terraces. If all terraces
    once developed remained, and if delta-building proceeded without
    interruption from waves, the relations should be somewhat as follows:
    Traced down-stream, the cliff between the oldest (highest) terrace and
    the next younger becomes gradually lower until it finally disappears,
    and the continuation of the two is found in a common plain. The cliff
    between the second and third terraces should disappear in the same way,
    and below its disappearance the plain representing their continuation
    is continuous with that representing the continuation of the first and
    second. The cliff between the second and third terraces may or may not
    continue farther down-stream than that between the first and second.
    The plains below the terraces finally become continuous with the lowest
    flood-plain and with the delta. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span> relations can rarely be seen
    because of the destruction of the older terraces, and because of the
    erosion by waves along shore.</p>

    showing two terraces below, one in the middle, and none above. The
    relations are purely diagrammatic.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The topography of terraces is similar to that of flood-plains, except
    in so far as modified by erosion. While flat in general, the terrace
    may slope either toward or from the valley bluff, and its surface
    may be marked by all the minor irregularities which characterize a
    flood-plain.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE WORK OF GROUND- (UNDERGROUND) WATER.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">Many</span> familiar facts demonstrate the general presence of abundant water
    beneath the surface of the land. The thousands of wells in regions
    peopled by civilized races, and the countless springs which issue from
    the sides of mountains and valleys are a sufficient proof both of the
    wide distribution of ground-water and of its great abundance.</p>

  <p>Certain well-known facts make it clear that ground-water is intimately
    connected with rainfall. In a dry season the level of the water in
    wells commonly sinks, and after a heavy rain it rises (<a href="#Page_71"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 71</a>); and
    the amount of sinking is greater when the drought is long, and the
    rise is most notable when the rainfall is heavy. Many springs which
    discharge large quantities of water during a wet season flow with
    reduced volume, or cease to flow altogether in periods of drought.
    Furthermore, the water of springs and wells has the properties which
    rain-water would possess after sinking beneath the surface and
    dissolving mineral substances. Rain-water is seen to sink beneath the
    surface with every shower, and since this source seems altogether
    adequate for ground-water, and since no other source is known whence
    any considerable amount of ground-water might come, it is concluded
    that atmospheric precipitation is its chief source.</p>

  <p>Water gets beneath the surface by processes which are readily seen.
    Wherever the soil is porous some of the rain which falls upon it is
    absorbed. Sinking through the soil to the solid rock it finds cracks
    and pores through which it descends to great depths. Nowhere are the
    rocks beneath the mantle rock so compact and so free from cracks, when
    any considerable area is considered, as to prevent the percolation of
    water through them.</p>

  <p><b>Conditions influencing descent of rain-water.—</b>There are
    several conditions which influence not only the amount of water which
    sinks beneath the surface in a given area, but the proportion of the
    precipitation which follows this course. These are as follows: (1)
    <i>Amount of precipitation.</i>—In a general way it is true that the
    greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> the amount of precipitation the greater the amount of water
    which will sink beneath the surface. Other things being equal, a region
    of heavy precipitation is a region where wells are easily obtained and
    springs common. (2) <i>Rate of precipitation.</i>—A given amount of
    precipitation may be concentrated in a short interval, or distributed
    through a considerable period of time. In the latter case more of the
    water sinks beneath the surface; in the former, a larger proportion
    runs off over the surface. The reason is readily seen. Water passes
    through small spaces, such as those of soil, slowly, and its rate of
    passage decreases rapidly with decreasing size of the passageways.
    When rain falls rapidly on a surface of even moderately close texture,
    the uppermost layer of soil is promptly filled with water, and since
    the water passes downward slowly, the uppermost saturated part of the
    soil becomes virtually impervious. While in this condition, the water
    which falls on it will run off if there be slope, and stand if there be
    none. In the latter case it will sink slowly as the water in the soil
    passes down to lower levels. If precipitation takes place no faster
    than the water can sink through the soil, all the water may become
    ground-water. (3) <i>The topography of the surface</i> has much to do
    with determining the proportion of rainfall which becomes ground-water.
    If the surface be flat, more will sink in; if it be sloping, more of it
    will run off before it has time to sink. Other things being equal, the
    steeper the slope the larger the proportion of the rainfall which will
    run off over it. (4) <i>The texture of the soil</i>, or other material
    on which the rain falls, helps to determine what proportion of it sinks
    beneath the surface. If the surface materials be porous, the water
    sinks readily; if of close texture, it finds less ready ingress. Other
    things being equal, the closer the texture of the soil the less the
    proportion of the rainfall which will enter it. (5) <i>The texture and
    structure of the rock</i> beneath the surface have some influence on
    the amount of ground-water. The rock may be stratified or massive; it
    may be abundantly or sparsely jointed; it may be porous or compact. On
    the whole, stratified rock is more favorable for the entrance of water
    than unstratified, partly because of its greater average porosity,
    and partly because the planes of division between beds often allow
    the passage of water. If the beds of stratified rock are vertical or
    inclined, water finds its way into them more readily than if they are
    horizontal, in so far as it descends along stratification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> planes.
    Horizontally bedded rock, or rock which is not bedded at all, may be so
    much jointed, and the joints so open, as to allow the water to enter
    readily.</p>

  <p>The conditions favorable to the sinking of abundant water below the
    surface are therefore heavy precipitation, falling slowly on a surface
    with little relief, a soil of open texture underlain by rock which is
    porous, or affected by vertical or highly inclined planes of cleavage.
    The annual discharge of water by rivers is estimated to be about 22
    percent. of the rainfall on the land.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

  <p><b>Supply of ground-water not altogether dependent on local
    rainfall.—</b>The amount of ground-water in a given region is not
    always entirely dependent on the local rainfall. Ground-water is in
    constant movement, and entering the soil or rock at one point it may,
    after a long subterranean journey, reach a point far from that at which
    it entered. Thus beneath the Great Plains of the West there is much
    subterranean water which fell on the eastern slopes of the mountains to
    the west. It has flowed beneath the surface to the Plains, where some
    of it is now withdrawn for the purposes of irrigation in regions where
    rainfall is deficient. The accompanying diagram (<a href="#fig199"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 199</a>) illustrates
    the flow here described.</p>

    the ground-water surface (the dotted line) in a region of undulatory topography.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The ground-water surface. Water table.—</b>The water table has
    already been defined (<a href="#Page_71"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 71</a>) as the upper surface of the ground-water.
    In a flat region of uniform structure the ground-water surface is
    essentially level, but rises and falls with the rainfall. Where the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>topography of a region is not flat, the ground-water surface is not
    level. As a rule it is higher, though farther below the surface, under
    an elevation than under surrounding lowlands, as illustrated by <a href="#fig200"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    200</a>. The explanation is not far to seek. If a hill of sand be exposed
    to rainfall, most of the water falling on its porous surface will sink
    into it. If the precipitation continues long enough, as in a protracted
    rain, the hill of sand will be filled with water, the water occupying
    the interstices between the grains. If the sand of the hill could be
    removed, leaving the water which it contains on the same area, it would
    constitute a mound perhaps a third or a fourth as high as the hill
    itself. If unsupported, this mound of water would spread promptly in
    all directions until its surface was level. While the sand remains,
    the water in it constitutes a mound, and has a tendency to spread. It
    does in fact spread, but since the process involves great friction
    the spreading is slow. With the spreading the surface of the water in
    the sand sinks, and sinks fastest at the center where it is highest
    (<i>b</i>, <a href="#fig201"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 201</a>). If the process were not interrupted the surface
    of the water in the hill would, in time, sink approximately to the
    level of the water in the surrounding land (<i>d</i>, <a href="#fig201"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 201</a>); but
    at every stage preceding the last, the surface of the water would be
    higher beneath the summit of the hill than elsewhere, though farther
    from the surface. In regions of even moderate precipitation the water
    surface beneath the hills rarely sinks to the level of that in the
    lowlands adjacent, before being raised by further rains.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig201">
    <img class="illowp66" src="images/fig201.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 201.—Diagram to illustrate the relations
    of ground-water to the surface.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The water-level beneath the lowlands also sinks. Some of it finds its
    way into valleys, some of it sinks to greater depths, and some of it
    evaporates; but since the water surface beneath the elevation sinks
    more rapidly than that beneath the lowland, the two approach a common
    level. Their difference will be least at the end of a drought, and
    greatest just after heavy rains.</p>

  <p><b>Depth to which ground-water sinks.—</b>The depth to which
    ground-water penetrates has not been determined empirically. No
    borings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> or excavations of any sort have been made to such depths as
    to indicate that its limit was being approached, though some of them
    are a mile or more deep. There is a popular belief that water sinks
    until it reaches a temperature sufficient to convert it into steam, but
    except for special localities where hot lava lies near the surface,
    this belief is not well founded. In the first place, it is not known
    at what temperature water below the surface would be converted into
    steam. While water boils at sea-level at a temperature of 212° (<abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>)
    a higher temperature would be necessary below that level.</p>

  <p>Assuming the temperature of water sinking beneath the surface to
    be 50° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, its temperature must be raised 162° to bring it to
    the temperature at which it would boil at sea-level. On the above
    assumption of initial temperature, the following table shows the depths
    at which water would reach a temperature of 212° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> under various
    assumptions as to the rate of increase of temperature. It shows also
    the pressure in atmospheres which would exist at these several depths
    if the overlying rock were full of water.</p>

  <p>The temperature at which water boils increases with the pressure. A
    pressure of about 200 atmospheres is the critical pressure for water;
    that is, the pressure which, if increased, will prevent boiling
    altogether. The depth at which a pressure of 200 atmospheres would
    be reached, supposing the upper rock to be full of water, is about
    6800 feet. The temperature of the water at this depth, under various

  <p>Only one of these temperatures reaches the boiling-point of water <i>at
    sea-level</i>. It is therefore clear that at this depth water has not
    even closely approached the boiling temperature <i>for this depth</i>,
    and since this is the depth of the critical pressure, it is clear that
    it cannot boil at any greater depth. The descent of water is therefore
    not stopped, under normal conditions of crustal temperature, because
    it reaches its boiling-point. Locally, as in the vicinity of active or
    recently extinct volcanoes, the case may be different.</p>

  <p>There is good reason, in the increasing density beneath the surface,
    for believing that the rate of increase of temperature decreases with
    depth, and therefore that the rate of 1° for 50 feet for the depths
    concerned is too high. The greater depths of the table above are
    therefore believed to more nearly represent the truth than the lesser
    ones. (See discussion of underground temperature in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>.)</p>

  <p>If descending water attained its critical temperature, the extent to
    which the resulting <i>water-gas</i> might be absorbed is not known.
    <i>So far as limited by temperature</i>, therefore, it is not possible
    to assign a limit to the descent of water under average conditions of
    crustal temperature.</p>

  <p>Other considerations seem to place a limit to the descent of water.
    Rock, solid and unyielding as it seems, is yet plastic when under
    sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> great pressure. The cracks and cavities affecting it are
    believed to descend a distance which is but slight in comparison with
    the radius of the earth. Even if openings were once formed at greater
    depths, they could not persist, for the adjacent rock, under the
    pressure which there exists, would “flow” in, in effect (though perhaps
    not in principle) much as stiff liquid might, and close them. The outer
    zone of the earth where cavities may exist is known as the <i>zone
    of fracture</i>.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The depth of the zone of fracture differs for
    different rocks, but is not believed to extend below some such depth as
    five or six miles, even for the most resistant.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It is to be noted
    that these depths are less than those at which the critical temperature
    of water would be reached under most of the conditions, including all
    the more probable ones, specified in the above table.</p>

  <p>Let it be assumed that water descends through openings in the rock
    to a depth of six miles. At this depth it would, under the various
    assumptions specified in the first and second columns of the following
    table, have the temperature indicated in the third column:</p>

  <p>In two of these cases, namely, those in which the assumed rate of
    increase of temperature is highest, the temperature of the water at
    the assumed lower limit of the zone of fracture is above the critical
    temperature of water. If the assumptions involved in these two cases be
    correct, water might descend to the point where it would be converted
    into water-gas, and in this condition it might be occluded by the hot
    rock. In the other cases, involving the more probable assumptions, the
    critical temperature is not reached at a depth of six miles. If pores
    and cracks do not extend to greater depths, liquid water could not; and
    since the water at this depth has probably not reached its critical
    temperature, it cannot exist as water-gas. If it does not exist <span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>in the
    form of water-gas, its occlusion by the hot rock substance would not
    be probable. It would seem, therefore, that the descent of water under
    ordinary conditions is much more likely to be limited by the <i>zone of
    fracture</i>, than by temperature.</p>

  <p><b>Movement of ground-water.</b><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>—Ground-water is in more or less
    continual movement. If all the water be pumped out of a well it soon
    fills up again to its normal level by inflow from all sides. Springs
    and flowing wells also demonstrate the movement of ground-water. Near
    the surface the movement of ground-water is primarily downward if the
    medium through which it passes is equally permeable in all directions;
    but so soon as the descending water reaches the water surface, its
    descent is checked and its movement is partly lateral.</p>

  <p>The commonest sort of movement of ground-water is that exemplified
    as the water sinks beneath the surface, namely, slow percolation
    through the pores and cracks of the soil and rock. Ground-water is
    not generally organized into definite streams, though underground
    streams, mostly small, are sometimes seen in caves and crevices, and
    sometimes issue as springs. Most underground streams which issue as
    springs probably have definite channels for short distances only
    before they issue. It is probable that ground-water frequently flows
    in considerable quantity along somewhat definite planes, without
    having open channels. Thus every porous bed of rock is likely to
    serve as the pathway along which subterranean drainage passes. This
    is especially true where the porous bed is underlain by an impervious
    one. The “reservoirs” from which artesian wells draw their supply are
    not usually streams or lakes, but porous beds of rock through which
    abundant water passes. As the supply is drawn off at one point, it is
    renewed by water entering elsewhere. Since the freedom of movement of
    ground-water is notably influenced by the porosity of the rock, and
    since the rock is, on the average, most porous and the pores largest
    near the surface, the movement of ground-water is, on the average,
    greatest near the surface, and least at its lower limit. In general the
    decrease of movement is much more rapid than the decrease in the size
    of the pores. It follows that while the upper part of the ground-water,
    especially that above ground-water level, moves somewhat freely, the
    lower part moves <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>much more slowly. It is probable, indeed, that the
    movement in the lower part of the subterranean hydrosphere is extremely
    slight.</p>

  <p><b>The amount of ground-water.—</b>The porosity of surface rocks varies
    widely, and the porosity of but few has been determined.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Such
    determinations as have been made are chiefly on building stones, in
    which the range of porosity varies from a fraction of one percent.,
    in the case of granite, to nearly 30 percent. in the case of some
    sandstones. Building stone is perhaps more dense than the average
    surface rock. Furthermore, such tests as have been made do not take
    account of the larger cracks and openings of rock, for these would
    not appear in the specimens tested; nor of the mantle rock, which
    generally contains a large amount of water. From such determinations
    as have been made it is estimated that the average porosity of the
    outer part of the lithosphere is somewhere between 5 and 10 percent.
    If the porosity diminishes regularly to a depth of six miles, where
    it becomes zero, the average porosity to this depth would be half
    the surface porosity.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> An average porosity of two and one-half
    percent. would mean that the rock contains enough water to form a
    layer nearly 800 feet deep. With an average porosity of 5 percent.,
    this figure would be doubled.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> While these figures are not to be
    regarded as measurements, they perhaps give some idea of the amount of
    ground-water. It is this sphere of ground-water which justifies the
    term <i>hydrosphere</i>, as applied to the waters of the earth.</p>

  <p><b>Fate of ground-water.—</b>Most of the water which sinks into the
    earth reaches the surface again after a longer or shorter journey. Some
    of it is evaporated from the surface directly; some of it is taken up
    by plants and is passed by them into the atmosphere; some of it issues
    in the form of springs; some of it seeps out; some of it is drawn out
    through wells; and much of the remainder finds its way underground
    to the sea or to lakes, issuing as springs beneath them. A small
    portion of the descending waters enters into permanent combination
    with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>mineral matter. Many minerals are known to take up water, being
    changed thereby from an anhydrous to a hydrous condition. It does not
    necessarily follow, however, that the total supply of water is thereby
    decreasing. Minerals once hydrated may be dehydrated subsequently,
    the water being set free. Furthermore, considerable quantities of
    water in the form of vapor issue from volcanoes, and volcanic vents
    often continue to steam long after volcanic action proper has ceased.
    It is probable that some, and perhaps much of the water issuing from
    these vents has never been at the surface before, and it is not now
    possible to affirm that the supply from this source does not offset, or
    even surpass, the depletion of the hydrosphere resulting from mineral
    hydration.</p>

  <h3>THE WORK OF GROUND-WATER.</h3>

  <p>Ground-water effects very considerable results in the course of its
    history. These results are partly chemical and partly mechanical, the
    former being far more important than the latter.</p>

  <h4><i>Chemical Work.</i></h4>

  <p>The results of the chemical and chemico-physical action of water may be
    grouped in several more or less distinct categories.</p>

  <p>1. The simplest effect is the <i>subtraction</i> of soluble mineral
    matter. Pure water is in itself a solvent of certain minerals; but
    the carbonic-acid gas extracted from the atmosphere, and the products
    of organic decay extracted from the soil make ground-water a much
    more efficient solvent. Something of the results which it achieves
    is shown by its composition. All ground-water, whether issuing as
    springs or drawn out through wells, contains much more mineral matter
    than the water which falls as rain, and the excess is acquired in its
    underground course.</p>

  <p>The subtraction of soluble matter from rock renders it porous. The
    amount of material dissolved from a given place may be trivial or
    considerable, according to the character of the rock, the readiness
    with which water has access to it, and the character of the water.
    Locally, the subtraction of mineral matter may be the chief, or even
    the only appreciable, effect of the ground-water.</p>

  <p>2. It sometimes happens that ground-water with certain mineral
    substances in solution exchanges them for other substances extracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
    from the rock. Thus the process of <i>substitution</i> is effected.
    By this process the lime carbonate of a shell imbedded in rock may
    be removed, molecule by molecule, and some other substance, such
    as silica, left in its place. When the process is complete, the
    substance of the shell has been completely removed, though its form
    and structure are still preserved in the new material which has taken
    the place of the old. Buried logs are sometimes converted into stone
    by the substitution of mineral matter for the vegetable tissue. This
    is <i>petrification</i>. Petrification is altogether distinct from
    <i>incrustation</i>, which simply means the coating of an object with
    mineral matter. A bird’s nest may be incrusted with lime carbonate,
    but it is not thereby petrified. Solution is a necessary antecedent of
    substitution.</p>

  <p>3. The materials which are subtracted from the rock at one point
    may be added to other rock elsewhere. Thus a third type of change,
    <i>addition</i>, is effected. Rock may at one time and place be
    rendered porous by the subtraction of some of its substance, and
    the openings thus formed may subsequently become the receptacles
    of deposits from solution. This is exemplified in the stalactitic
    deposits of many caves. Not uncommonly cracks and fissures are filled
    with mineral matter deposited by the waters which pass through them.
    Thus arise <i>veins</i> which, for the most part, are nothing more
    than cracks and crevices filled by mineral matter brought to them in
    solution, and precipitated on their walls. Most veins of metallic ores
    have originated in this way.</p>

  <p>4. A further series of changes is effected by ground-water when it,
    or the mineral matter it contains, enters into combination with the
    mineral matter through which it passes. One of the commonest processes
    of this sort, hydration, has already been referred to (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_43">43</a> and <a href="#Page_428">428</a>);
    but in the development of many of the commoner hydrous minerals changes
    other than hydration are involved. These changes result in <i>new
    mineral combinations</i>, the new minerals being developed out of the
    old, usually with some additions or subtractions. In the long course of
    time changes of this sort may be very great, so great indeed that large
    bodies of rock are radically changed, both chemically and physically.
    Much of the old substance may remain, but it has entered into new and
    more stable combinations with the materials which the water has brought
    to it.</p>

  <p><b>Quantitative importance of solution.—</b>In general, solution is
    probably most effective at a relatively slight distance below the
    surface.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> In the outermost zone of mantle rock the materials are
    usually less soluble than below, for they often represent the residuum
    after the soluble parts of the formation from which they originated
    were dissolved out. Below this zone the rock contains more soluble
    matter, and the water, charged with organic matter in its descent
    through the soil, is in condition to dissolve it. At greater depths
    the water has become saturated to some extent, and, so far forth, less
    active. Here, too, the movement is less free. The increased pressure
    at considerable depths, on the other hand, facilitates solution, which
    must be understood to take place under proper circumstances in any zone
    reached by the water.</p>

  <p>Calculations have been made which illustrate the quantitative
    importance of the solution effected by ground-water. The springs of
    Leuk (Switzerland) bring to the surface annually more than 2000 tons of
    calcium sulphate (gypsum) in solution, and in the same time the springs
    of Bath (England) bring up an amount of mineral matter in solution
    sufficient to make a column 9 feet in diameter, and 140 feet high.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

  <p>The amount of mineral matter in solution in streams is also
    significant, for while stream-water is not all derived from
    ground-water, much of it had such an origin. In the case of several
    streams, among them the Thames and the Elbe, careful estimates of the
    amount of dissolved mineral matter have been made. Though the Thames
    drains an area only about one-tenth as large as the State of New York,
    it is estimated to carry about 1500 tons of mineral matter in solution
    to the sea daily.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

  <p>From the uppermost 20,000 square miles of its drainage basin the Elbe
    is estimated to carry yearly about 1,370,000 tons of mineral matter in
    solution. Estimates of the amounts of material carried to the sea in
    solution by several rivers are given on <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_102">102</a> and <a href="#Page_103">103</a>. Much of this
    matter was brought to the rivers by waters which had been underground
    before reaching the streams.</p>

  <p>From these figures it is clear that we have to reckon here with a very
    considerable factor in the lowering of land surfaces. From the amount
    of lime carbonate carried by the Thames it has been estimated <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>that
    the average amount of this material dissolved from the limestone area
    drained by this stream is 143<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> tons per square mile per year. It is
    estimated that, on the average, something like one-third as much matter
    is carried to the sea in solution as in the form of sediment, and that
    by this process alone land areas would be lowered something like one
    foot in 13,000 years.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

  <p><b>Deposition of mineral matter from solution.—</b>The deposition of
    material from solution is effected in several ways. (1) It is sometimes
    deposited by evaporation. This is well shown where water seeps out on
    arid lands. The same process is illustrated when water is boiled. (2)
    Reduction of temperature often occasions deposition. In general, hot
    water is a better solvent of mineral matter than cold,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and if it
    issues with abundant mineral matter in solution the precipitation of
    some of it is likely to take place. (3) Plants sometimes cause the
    precipitation of mineral matter from solution. About some hot springs,
    even where the temperature of the water is very high small plants of
    low type (algæ) grow in profusion. In ways which are not perfectly
    understood these algæ extract the mineral matter from the hot water.
    They are now thought to be a chief factor in the deposits about the
    hot springs of the Yellowstone Park.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The influence of organisms
    on precipitation from solution is not confined to the waters of hot
    springs. (4) A fourth factor involved in the deposition of mineral
    matter from solution is pressure. Pressure increases the solvent power
    of water with respect to minerals directly; it produces the same effect
    indirectly by its effect on the solution of gases. As water charged
    with gas comes to the surface, the pressure is relieved and some of the
    gas escapes. Such mineral matter as was held in solution by the help
    of the gas which escapes is then precipitated. (5) Precipitation is
    also sometimes effected by the mingling of waters containing different
    mineral substances in solution. Such mingling of solutions would be
    most common along lines of ready subterranean <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>flow, and while each
    portion of the water entering a crevice or porous bed may be able to
    keep its own mineral matter in solution, their mingling may involve
    chemical changes resulting in the formation of insoluble compounds,
    and therefore in deposition. This principle has probably been involved
    in the filling of many fissures and crevices, converting them into
    veins. (6) The escape of gases from water, whether from increase of
    temperature or by the disturbance of water, sometimes causes the
    deposition of mineral matter held in solution.</p>

  <p>The deposition of material held in solution is most notable at two
    zones, one below that of most active solution, and the other at the
    surface, where evaporation is active. Under proper conditions, however,
    deposition may take place at any level reached by water.</p>

  <h4><i>Mechanical Work.</i></h4>

  <p>The mechanical work of ground-water is relatively unimportant. Wherever
    it is organized into definite streams, the channels through which it
    flows are likely to be increased by mechanical erosion as well as by
    solution. Either beneath the surface, or after the streams issue, the
    mechanical sediment carried will be deposited.</p>

  <h3>RESULTS OF THE WORK OF GROUND-WATER.</h3>

    Surv.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Weathering.—</b>Where the solution effected by ground-water in any
    locality is slight and equally distributed, the result is to make
    the rock porous. If, for example, some of the cement of sandstone is
    dissolved, the texture of the rock becomes more open; but if all the
    cement be removed the rock is changed from sandstone to sand. If a
    complex crystalline rock contains among its many minerals some one
    which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> more soluble than the others, that one may be dissolved. This
    has the effect of breaking up the rock, since each mineral acts as a
    binder for the rest. It might happen that no one of the minerals is
    dissolved completely, but that some one of them is decomposed by water,
    and certain of its constituents removed. Such change would be likely
    to cause the mineral so affected to crumble, and with its crumbling,
    if it be an important constituent of the rock, the integrity of the
    rock is destroyed. Where considerable chemical changes, especially
    subtractions, are going on, the rock is likely to crumble. The increase
    in volume attendant on hydration, etc., sometimes leads to the
    disruption of rock. These are phases of weathering. (For other phases
    of weathering see <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_54">54</a> and <a href="#Page_110">110</a>.)</p>

  <p><b>Caverns.</b><a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>—Where local solution is very great results of
    another sort may be effected. In formations like limestone, which are
    relatively soluble, considerable quantities of material are frequently
    dissolved from a given place. Instead of making the rock porous, in
    the usual sense of the term, large caverns may be developed (<a href="#fig202"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    202</a>). In their production, solution may be abetted by the mechanical
    action of the water passing through the openings which solution has
    developed. Considerable caves are found chiefly in limestone. They were
    probably developed when the surface relief was slight, and surface
    drainage therefore poor. Regions where caves were developed under these
    conditions may subsequently acquire relief, so that caves are not now
    confined to flat regions.</p>

  <p>One of the best known regions of caves is in the basin of the Ohio in
    Kentucky and southern Indiana, where the number of caves is large,
    and the size of some of them, such as Mammoth and Wyandotte, very
    great. A ground-plan of Wyandotte (Ind.) Cave is shown in <a href="#fig203"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 203</a>. The
    aggregate length of the passageways is about 23½ miles.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>
  <p>Deposition often takes place in caves after they are formed (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig204">204</a>
    and <a href="#fig205">205</a>). It may even go on at the same time that the cave is being
    excavated. Here are formed the well-known stalactites and stalagmites.
    A stalactite may start from a drop of water leaking through the roof
    of the cave. Evaporation, or the escape of some of the carbonic gas in
    solution, results in the deposition of some of the lime carbonate about
    the margin of the drop, in the form of a ring. Successive drops make
    successive deposits on the lower edge of the ring, which grows downward
    into a hollow tube through which descending water passes, making its
    chief deposits at the end. Deposition in the tube may ultimately close
    it, while deposition on the outside, due to water trickling down in
    that position, may greatly enlarge it.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig206">

  <p>Underground caves sometimes give rise to topographic features which
    are of local importance. When the solution of material in a cavern
    has gone so far that its roof becomes thin and weak, it may collapse,
    giving rise to a sink or depression in the surface over the site<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> of
    the original cave. This is so common that regions of limestone caves
    are often affected by frequent sinks formed in this way. They are a
    conspicuous feature of the landscape in the cave region of Kentucky,
    and are well known in many other limestone districts. They are known as
    <i>limestone sinks</i>. (<a href="#fig206"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 206</a> and <a href="#plate_XVIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XVII</a>.)</p>

  <p>Under certain circumstances caves may give rise to striking features
    of another sort. If for any reason the roof is destroyed at the two
    ends of a cave, remaining intact over the middle, the latter part
    constitutes a <i>natural bridge</i>. Natural bridges also originate in
    other ways (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_151">151</a>, <a href="#Page_153">153</a>).</p>

    Mountain, Washington. The slumping material in this case is basalt.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Creep, slumps, and landslides.—</b>When the soil and subsoil on a
    slope become charged with water they tend to move downward. When the
    movement is too slow to be sensible it is called <i>creep</i>. The
    common downward inclination of trees growing in such situations, the
    result of the more rapid creep of the surface as compared with the
    deeper part of the soil, is both an expression of the movement and of
    its slowness. Other factors besides ground-water are involved in creep
    (see <a href="#Page_112"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 112</a>).</p>

  <p>When the movement is rapid enough to be sensible the material is
    said to <i>slump</i> or <i>slide</i>. This may happen when the slope
    on which water-charged mantle rock lies is steep (<a href="#fig207"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 207</a>). Great
    landslides of this sort have been recorded, and some of them have done
    great damage. Where a stream’s banks are high, and of unindurated
    material, such as clay, considerable masses sometimes slump from the
    bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> or bluff into the river, or settle away slowly from their former
    positions. This is a common phenomenon along streams which have cut
    valleys in drift, and along shores on which waves are encroaching. The
    same phenomenon is common on a larger scale on the slopes of steep
    mountains.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Considerable terraces are sometimes developed on their
    slopes in this way, but they are usually irregular and discontinuous
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig208">208</a>, and <a href="#fig209">209</a>). The loose débris on steep slopes sometimes
    assumes a sort of flowing motion and descends the slope with some such
    form and at some such rate as a glacier. Such bodies of débris are
    sometimes called “talus glaciers” (<a href="#fig210"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 210</a>). In many such cases, snow
    and ice have had some part in their development.</p>

  <p>In creep and in landslides gravity is the force involved, and the
    ground-water only a condition which makes gravity effective. Gravity
    alone accomplishes similar results, as illustrated by <a href="#fig211"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 211</a>.</p>

  <h4><i>Summary.</i></h4>

  <p>All in all, ground-water is to be looked upon as a most important
    geological agent. When it is remembered that a very large part of all
    the water which falls on the surface of the earth, either in the form
    of rain or snow, sinks beneath the surface; that much of it sinks to
    a great depth; that much of it has a long underground course before
    it reappears at the surface; that it is everywhere and always active,
    either in subtracting from the rock through which it passes, in adding
    to it, in effecting the substitution of one mineral substance for
    another, or in bringing about new chemical combinations; and when it
    is remembered that this process has been going on for untold millions
    of years, it will be seen that the total result accomplished must be
    stupendous. The rock formations of the earth to the depths to which
    ground-water penetrates are to be looked upon as a sort of chemical
    laboratory through which waters are circulating in all directions,
    charged with all sorts of mineral substances. Some of the substances
    in solution are deposited beneath the surface, and some are brought to
    the surface where the waters issue. Much of the material brought to
    the surface in solution is carried to the sea and utilized by marine
    organisms in the making of shells. Without the mineral matter brought
    to the sea by springs and rivers, many shell-bearing animals of great
    importance, geologically, would perish. Biologically, therefore, as
    well as geologically, ground-water is of great importance.</p>

  <h3>SPRINGS AND FLOWING WELLS.</h3>

  <p>The term <i>spring</i> is applied to any water which issues from
    beneath the surface with sufficient volume to cause a distinct current.
    If the water issues so slowly as to merely keep the surface moist, it
    is not called a spring, but seepage. The spring from which water issues
    with a strong current, especially if it be upward, is comparable to
    a flowing well, while the spring from which water issues with little
    force, and without upward movement, is comparable to the flow of water
    into a common well.</p>

  <p>Springs often issue from the sides of valleys (<a href="#fig212"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 212</a>), the bottoms
    of which are below ground-water level. They are especially likely to
    issue at the surface of relatively impervious layers, and where the
    valley slopes cut joints, porous beds, or other structures which allow
    free flow of ground-water.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig212">
    <img class="illowp90" src="images/fig212.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 212.—Diagram illustrating positions,
      <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, favorable for springs.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Springs are classified in various ways, and these several
    classifications suggest characteristics worthy of note. They are
    sometimes said to be <i>deep</i> and <i>shallow</i>. The “deep”
    spring, as the term is ordinarily used, is one which issues with
    great force, and with something of upward movement, and the “shallow”
    spring, one which issues with little force, and without upward
    movement; but the spring which issues with force is not necessarily
    deep, nor is the one which issues with little force necessarily
    shallow. The idea involved in this grouping would be better expressed
    by <i>strong</i> and <i>feeble</i>. Springs are also classified as
    <i>cold</i> and <i>thermal</i>, the latter term meaning simply that
    the temperature is such as to make the springs seem warm or hot. The
    temperature of thermal springs ranges up to the boiling-point of
    water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> Between deep springs and shallow ones, and between cold springs
    and thermal, respectively, there is no sharp line of demarkation.
    Again, some springs are continuous in their flow, while others are
    <i>intermittent</i>. Most intermittent springs flow after periods of
    precipitation, but dry up during droughts (see <a href="#Page_202"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 202</a>). Springs are
    also classified as <i>mineral</i> and <i>common</i>. Mineral springs,
    in the popular sense of the term, are of two types: (1) Those which
    contain an unusual amount of mineral matter, and (2) those which
    contain some unusual mineral. Springs are especially likely to be
    called mineral if the substances which they contain, have, or are
    supposed to have, some medicinal property. All springs which are
    not “mineral” are “common.” This classification is not altogether
    rational, for all springs contain more or less mineral matter, and
    many springs which are “common,” contain more mineral matter than some
    springs that are “mineral.” Mineral springs are themselves classified
    according to the kind and amount of mineral matter they contain. Thus
    <i>saline</i> springs contain salt; <i>sulphur</i> springs contain
    compounds (especially gaseous) of sulphur; <i>chalybeate</i> springs
    contain iron compounds, especially the sulphate; <i>calcareous</i>
    springs contain abundant lime carbonate, etc. These various mineral
    substances are extracted from the rock, sometimes by simple solution,
    and sometimes by solution resulting from other chemical change. The
    salt of saline springs is usually extracted from beds of salt beneath
    the surface. Lime carbonate, one of the commonest substances in
    solution in ground-water, is dissolved from limestone, or derived by
    chemical change from rocks containing other calcium compounds. Thus
    lime feldspars, by carbonation, give rise to lime carbonate. The
    chalybeate waters often arise from the oxidation of iron sulphide, a
    mineral which is common in many sedimentary rocks. The iron sulphate
    is itself subject to change in the presence of the ubiquitous lime
    carbonate. From this change iron carbonate results, and this is usually
    quickly altered to iron oxide, which, being relatively insoluble,
    is precipitated. About chalybeate springs, therefore, iron oxide is
    frequently being deposited. <i>Medicinal</i> springs are those which
    contain some substance or substances which have, or are supposed to
    have, curative properties.</p>

  <p><b>Mineral matter in solution.—</b>The number and variety of mineral
    substances in spring water is very great, and the amount of solid
    matter in solution varies widely. Some of the hot springs of the
    Yellowstone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> Park contain nearly three grams (2.8733) of mineral matter
    per kilogram.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

  <p>The composition of various spring and well waters is shown in the
    accompanying table, which gives some idea of the range of mineral
    substances commonly in solution in ground-water.</p>

  <p><b>Geysers.—</b>Geysers are intermittently eruptive hot springs. They
    occur only in volcanic regions (past or present) and in but few of
    them. Active geysers are virtually confined to the Yellowstone Park and
    Iceland, though they formerly existed at other places. Those of New
    Zealand have but recently become extinct. The great geyser region of
    the world is the Yellowstone Park, where there are said to be more than
    sixty active geysers.</p>

  <p>The cause of the eruption is steam. The surface-water sinks down until,
    at some unknown depth, it comes into contact with rock sufficiently hot
    to boil it. The source of the heat is not open to inspection, but it is
    believed to be the uncooled part of an extrusive lava flow, or of an
    intrusive lava mass. From what was said on <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_216">216</a> and <a href="#Page_217">217</a> it is clear
    that geysers do not have their origin in water which sinks down to the
    zone of great heat, where the increment of heat is normal.</p>

  <p>The water of a geyser issues through a tube of unknown length. Whether
    the tube is open down to the source of the heat is not determinable,
    but water from such a source finds its way to the tube. Water may enter
    the tube from all sides and at various levels from top to bottom. The
    heating may precede or follow its entrance into the tube, or both. So
    far as the water is heated after it enters the tube, the point of most
    rapid heating may be at the bottom of the tube or at some point above.
    If the temperature of the source of heat were high enough to convert
    the descending water into steam as fast as it enters the tube, the
    steam would escape continuously, though there would be no geyser; but
    if the rock is only hot enough to bring the water to the boiling-point
    after some lapse of time, and after some water has accumulated, an
    eruption is possible.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The exact sequence of events which leads up to an eruption is not
    known, but a definite conception of the principles involved may
    perhaps be secured by a definite case. Suppose a geyser-tube filled
    with water, and heated at its lower end. As the water is heated below,
    convection tends to distribute the heat throughout the column of
    water above. If convection were free, and the tube short, the result
    would be a boiling spring; but if the tube is long, and especially
    if convection is impeded, the water at some level below the surface
    may be brought to the boiling-point earlier than that at the top.
    Under these circumstances if even a little water in the lower part of
    the tube is converted into steam, the steam will raise the column of
    water above, and it will overflow. The overflow relieves the pressure
    on all parts of the column of water below the surface. If before the
    overflow there was any considerable volume of water essentially ready
    to boil, the relief of pressure following the overflow might allow it
    to be converted into steam suddenly, and the sudden conversion of any
    considerable quantity of water into steam would cause the eruption of
    all the water above it (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig213">213</a> and <a href="#fig214">214</a>). The height to which the
    water would be thrown would depend upon the amount of steam, the size
    and straightness of the tube, etc.</p>

  <p>It is clear that everything which impedes convection in the geyser
    tube will hasten the period of eruption, since impeded circulation
    will have the effect of holding the heat down, and so of bringing the
    water at some level below the top more quickly to the boiling-point.
    It follows that anything which chokes up the tube, or which increases
    the viscosity of the water, or its surface tension, would hasten an
    eruption.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

  <p>Geysers often build up crater-like basins or cones (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig214">214</a> to <a href="#fig217">217</a>)
    about themselves, the cone being of material deposited from solution.
    In the Yellowstone Park the precipitation of the matter in solution
    (chiefly silica) is partly due to cooling and partly to the algæ which
    abound even in the boiling water, and the brilliant colors of the
    deposits about the springs are attributable to these plants. When the
    water from any geyser or hot spring ceases to flow the plants die and
    the colors disappear. The details of the surface of the deposits about
    geysers and hot springs are often complicated, and frequently very
    beautiful (<a href="#fig218"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 218</a>).</p>

  <p>The heating of geyser and hot-spring water must cool the lava or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
    other source of heat below. As this takes place, the time between
    eruptions becomes longer and longer. In the course of time, therefore,
    the geyser must cease to be eruptive, and when this change is brought
    about the geyser becomes a hot spring. Within historic times several
    geysers have ceased to erupt and new ones have been developed. In the
    Yellowstone Park, where there are said to be something like 3000 vents
    of all sorts, hot springs which are not eruptive greatly outnumber the
    geysers. From many of the vents but little steam issues, and from some,
    little else.</p>

      Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone Park.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A few geysers have somewhat definite periods of eruption. Of such “Old
    Faithful” is the type; but even this geyser, which formerly erupted at
    regular intervals of about an hour, is losing the reputation on which
    its name is based. Not only is its period of eruption lengthening,
    but it is becoming irregular, and the irregularity appears to be
    increasing. In the short time during which this geyser has been under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
    observation its period has changed from a regular one of sixty minutes,
    or a little less, to an irregular one of seventy to ninety minutes.
    In the case of some geysers years elapse between eruptions, and in
    some the date of the last eruption is so distant that it is uncertain
    whether the vent should be looked upon as a geyser or merely a hot
    spring.</p>

  <p>In the Yellowstone Park<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> the geysers are mainly in the bottoms
    of valleys (<a href="#fig219"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 219</a>), but the deposits characteristic of geysers
    are found in not a few places well above the present bottoms. These
    deposits record the fact that in earlier times the geysers were at
    higher levels than now. It is probable that they have been, at all
    stages in their history, near the bottoms of the valleys, and that, as
    the valleys have been deepened the ground-water has found lower and
    lower points of issue. In this respect the geysers have probably had
    the same history as other springs.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

  <p>Unless new intrusions of lava occur, or unless heat is otherwise
    renewed at the proper points, it is probable that all existing geysers
    will become extinct within a time which is, geologically, short. New
    geyser regions may, however, develop as old ones disappear.</p>

  <p><b>Artesian wells.—</b>Originally the terms <i>artesian</i> wells and
    <i>flowing</i> wells were synonymous; but at the present time any
    notably deep well is called <i>artesian</i>, especially if it descends
    to considerable depths below the mantle rock. The artesian well which
    does not flow, does not differ from common wells in principle; but
    being deeper, the water which it affords is often more thoroughly
    filtered and frequently more highly mineralized than that of other
    wells. The flowing well is really a gushing spring, the opening of
    which was made by man.</p>

  <p>Flowing wells<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> depend upon certain relations of rock structure,
    water supply, and elevation. Generally speaking a flowing well is
    possible in any place underlain by any considerable bed of porous rock,
    if such rock outcrops at a sufficiently higher level in a region of
    adequate rainfall, and is covered by a layer or bed of impervious, or
    relatively impervious rock. This statement involves four conditions,
    all of which are illustrated by <a href="#fig199"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 199</a>, where <i>a</i> is the bed
    of porous rock. It is not necessary that the beds of rock form a
    structural basin, nor is it usually necessary to take account of the
    character of the rock beneath the porous bed which contains the water.</p>

  <p>The bed of porous rock is the “reservoir” of the flowing well.
    Formations of sand or sandstone, and of gravel or conglomerate, most
    commonly serve as the reservoirs. In order that it may contain abundant
    water it must have some thickness, and its outcropping edge must be so
    situated that the water may enter freely and be replenished, chiefly by
    rain, as the water flows out at the well.</p>

  <p>A relatively impervious layer of rock above the reservoir (<i>b</i>,
    <a href="#fig199"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 199</a>) is most important; otherwise the water in the reservoir will
    leak out, and there will be little or no “head” at the well site. Thus
    if the rock overlying stratum <i>a</i> (<a href="#fig199"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 199</a>) were badly broken,
    the fractures extending up to the surface, the conditions would be
    unfavorable for flowing wells. Under such conditions, wells in the
    positions of those shown in <a href="#fig199"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 199</a> might get abundant water, but they
    would not be likely to flow. If the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>stratum next below the reservoir
    is not impervious, some lower one probably is. No layer of rock is more
    impervious than one which is full of water, and the substructure of any
    bed which might serve as a reservoir is usually full of water, even if
    the rock be porous.</p>

  <p>If the outcrop of the reservoir be notably above the site of the well,
    and if it be kept full by frequent rains, the “head” will be strong,
    though the water at the well will not rise to the level of the outcrop
    of the reservoir. Experience has shown that an allowance of about one
    foot per mile of subterranean flow should be made. Thus if the site of
    the well be 100 miles from the outcrop of the water-bearing stratum,
    and 200 feet below it, the water will rise something like 100 feet
    above the surface at the well. This rule is, however, not applicable
    everywhere. The failure of the water to rise to the level of its head
    is due to the adhesion and the friction of flow through the rock. The
    more porous the rock the less the reduction of head by friction. The
    height of the flow is also influenced by the number of wells drawing on
    the same reservoir, on the degree of imperviousness of the confining
    bed above, etc.</p>

  <p>Flowing wells, often relatively shallow, are frequently obtained from
    unconsolidated drift. Some such relations as suggested by <a href="#fig220"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 220</a>
    would afford the conditions for flowing wells in such a formation.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE WORK OF SNOW AND ICE.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">A part</span> of the atmospheric precipitation falls as snow, and this, like
    the rain, does its appropriate work in degrading the land. Over the
    larger part of the land surface the snow of the winter does not endure
    through the succeeding summer, and when it melts it follows the same
    course as the precipitation which falls as rain; but in cold regions
    where the fall of snow is heavy some of it remains unmelted and
    constitutes perennial snow-fields.</p>

  <h3>SNOW- AND ICE-FIELDS.</h3>

  <p><b>Snow-fields.—</b>Mountain heights and polar lands are the most
    common habitats of snow-fields, though they are not confined to these
    situations. In North America there are numerous small snow-fields in
    the western mountains, from Mexico on the south to Alaska on the north,
    their number and size increasing in the latter direction. In the United
    States there are few snow-fields south of the parallel of 36° 30′, and
    most of the many hundreds north of that latitude (excluding Alaska) are
    small (<a href="#plate_XVIIIa"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XVIII, <abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1</a>, Washington,
    <abbr title="Latitude">Lat.</abbr> 48° 5′, <abbr title="Longitude">Long.</abbr> 121° 5′; <a href="#plate_XVIIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    2</a>, <abbr title="Latitude">Lat.</abbr> 41° 25′, <abbr title="Longitude">Long.</abbr> 122° 12′. From Glacier Peak and Shasta Special
    Quadrangles, <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>). Farther north, especially in Alaska,
    the snow-fields of the western mountains attain much greater size. In
    Europe snow-fields comparable to those of the northwestern part of
    the United States and British Columbia occur in the Alps (<a href="#fig221"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 221</a>),
    the Pyrenees, the Caucasus, and the Scandinavian mountains. In Asia
    snow-fields occur in the Himalayas and in many of the high mountains
    farther north, from Turkestan on the southwest nearly to the coast on
    the northeast. In South America there are snow-fields of small size
    even in equatorial latitudes, and farther south in the Chilean Andes
    there are some of considerable size. Small snow-fields occur on the
    highest peaks of tropical Africa, and in the mountains of New Zealand.
    For reasons which will appear later, much of every considerable
    snow-field is really ice.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

  <p>In addition to these limited fields of snow in mountain regions, there
    are fields of much greater extent covering wide expanses of plain
    and plateau in the polar regions. The greater part of the island of
    Greenland is covered with a single field of ice and snow, the size of
    which is variously estimated at 300,000 to 400,000 square miles (<a href="#fig222"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    222</a>)—an area 400 to 600 times as large as the snow-and-ice-covered
    area of Switzerland. Numerous islands to the west of North Greenland
    are also partly covered with snow, the areas of the snow-fields far
    exceeding those of most mountain regions. In Antarctica there is
    believed to be a still larger field, the largest of the earth. Its area
    is not even approximately known, but such data as are at hand indicate
    that it may have an extent of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 square miles.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The only condition necessary for a snow-field is an excess of snowfall
    over snow waste. The lower edge of a snow-field, the <i>snow-line</i>,
    is dependent chiefly on temperature and snowfall. In general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span> it does
    not depart much from the summer isotherm of 32°, though it may be well
    above this isotherm where the snowfall is light. That the snow-line
    is not a function of temperature only is shown by its position in
    various places. In the equatorial portion of the Andes, for example,
    the snow-line has an altitude of about 16,000 feet on the east side
    of the mountains, where the precipitation is heavier, and of about
    18,500 feet on the west side, where it is lighter. For the same reason
    the snow-line in the Himalayas is 3000 or 4000 feet lower on the
    <i>south</i> side than on the north.</p>

  <p>While in equatorial regions the snow-line has an altitude of 15,000 to
    18,000 feet, it approaches or even reaches sea-level in the latitude
    of Antarctica and North Greenland. In intermediate latitudes it has an
    intermediate position.</p>

  <p>While temperature and snowfall are the most important factors
    controlling the position of the snow-line, both humidity and the
    movements of the air are of some importance, since both affect the rate
    of evaporation of snow and ice.</p>

  <p><b>The passage of snow into névé and ice.—</b>The snow does not lie
    on the surface long before it undergoes obvious change. The light
    flakes soon begin to be transformed into granules, and the snow becomes
    “coarse-grained.” The granular character, so pronounced in the snow
    of the last banks which remain in the spring in temperate latitudes,
    is even more distinct in perennial snow-fields, either at the surface
    or just beneath it. This granular snow is called <i>névé</i>, or
    <i>firn</i>. Still deeper beneath the surface, where the thickness of
    the snow is great, the névé becomes more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> compact and finally coherent,
    and grades into porous ice. This gradation is accomplished at no great
    depth, though the thicknesses of snow and névé are by no means constant.</p>

  <p><b>Structure of the ice.—</b>Ice formed beneath a snow-field is in
    some sense stratified. It is made up of successive falls of snow which
    tend to retain the form of layers. This follows from two or three
    conditions. The snow of one season, or of one period of precipitation,
    may have been considerably changed before the succeeding fall of snow.
    So also the surface of the snow-field at the end of the melting season
    is often covered with a visible amount of earthy matter, some of which
    was blown up and dropped on the surface during the melting season, and
    some of which was concentrated in that position by the melting of the
    snow in which it was originally imbedded. The amount of earthy matter
    is often sufficient to define snows of successive years, or perhaps of
    minor periods of precipitation, and makes distinct the stratification
    which would otherwise remain obscure. The snowfall of successive years
    has been estimated by this means<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> where the snow is exposed in
    crevices in the snow-field.</p>

  <p>In addition to its rude stratification, the ice of the deeper portions
    often acquires a stratiform structure which may perhaps best be called
    <i>foliation</i> to distinguish it from the <i>stratification</i> which
    arises from deposition. The foliation appears to result mainly from the
    shearing of one part over another in the course of the movements to
    which the ice is subjected, as will be illustrated presently.</p>

  <p><b>Texture.—</b>The ice derived from the snow is formed of interlocking
    crystalline grains. The crystalline character is present from the
    beginning, for it is assumed by the snowflakes when they form, and
    the subsequent changes seem only to modify the original crystals
    by building up some and destroying others. By the time the snow is
    converted into névé, the granules have become coarse, and wherever the
    ice derived from the névé has been examined, the granular crystalline
    texture is present. The individual crystals in the ice are usually
    larger than those of the névé, and more closely grown together. In the
    fresh unexposed ice the crystals are so intimately interlocked that
    they are not readily seen except under a polarizing microscope, but
    when the ice has been honeycombed by partial melting, the granules
    become partially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> separated and may be easily seen. <a href="#fig223"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 223</a> shows
    quantities of them which have been washed down from the surface,
    and disposed as cones at its base. While a given mass of snow in a
    great snow- and ice-field cannot be followed consecutively through
    its whole history, yet since (1) the granular texture is pronounced
    in the névé stage where the granules show evidences of growth, and
    since (2) the same texture is also pronounced in the last stages of
    the ice when it is undergoing dissolution, as well as at all observed
    intermediate stages, and since (3) the crystals are, on the average,
    larger in proportion to the lateness of the stage of their history,
    while (4) experiment has shown that granules grow under the conditions
    which exist in snow-fields, and (5) that they persist under very
    considerable pressure, it is legitimate to assume that a granular
    crystalline condition persists throughout all stages, and is a feature
    of progressive growth.</p>

  <p><b>Inauguration of movement.—</b>Eventually the increase in depth of
    snow and ice in a snow-field gives rise to motion. The exact nature
    of the motion has not yet been demonstrated to the satisfaction of
    all investigators. Brittle and resistant as ice seems, it exhibits,
    under proper conditions, some of the outward characteristics of a
    plastic substance. Thus it may be made to change its form, and may
    even be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> moulded into almost any desired shape if carefully subjected
    to sufficient pressure, steadily applied through long intervals
    of time.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> These <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>changes may be brought about without visible
    fracture, and have been thought to point to a viscous condition of the
    ice. There is much reason, however, as will be seen later, to question
    this interpretation of the ultimate nature of the movement. Whatever
    this may be, the <i>mass result</i> of the movement in a field of ice
    is comparable, in a superficial way at least, to that which would be
    brought about if the ice were capable of moving like a viscous liquid,
    the motion taking place with extreme slowness. This slow motion of
    ice in an ice-field is <i>glacier motion</i>, and ice thus moving is
    <i>glacier ice</i>.</p>

  <p>If both the surface on which the ice-sheet develops and its
    surroundings be essentially plane, as may happen in high latitudes,
    and if the snow- and ice-field be symmetrical in shape, the outward
    movement will be approximately equal in all directions, and the area
    covered by the spreading ice-field will remain more or less circular.
    If the ice-field rests on a steeply inclined surface, like a mountain
    slope, the movement becomes one-sided in conformity to the slope. If
    the surface, otherwise plane, be affected by valleys parallel to the
    direction of movement, the ice in the valleys will be deeper than
    that on the divides between them, and its movement stronger. In the
    valleys, therefore, the ice will advance farther than elsewhere before
    being melted, and the outline of the ice will become lobate, the lobes
    occupying the depressions. These general relations are shown in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>
    <a href="#fig224">224</a> and <a href="#fig225">225</a>. If the depressions be wide and shallow, the lobes will be
    broad and short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> (<a href="#fig226"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 226</a>); if the depressions be narrow and deep, the
    lobes will be relatively narrow and <abbr title="Longitude">Long.</abbr> If the snow and ice rest on
    a surface consisting chiefly of steep valleys and sharp ridges, as is
    common on mountain slopes, the snow and ice are chiefly gathered in the
    valleys, and take a linear form.</p>

  <h3>TYPES OF GLACIERS.</h3>

  <p>These different forms give rise to different terms. The ice which
    spreads with some approach to equality in all directions from a
    center is a glacier, is indeed the type of the greatest glaciers,
    but is commonly called an <i>ice-cap</i>. The same name is applied
    to any glacier in which there is movement in all directions from
    the center, even though its shape departs widely from a circle. The
    glacier covering the larger part of Greenland (<a href="#fig222"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 222</a>) is a good
    example of a large ice-cap, and the glaciers on some of the flat-topped
    peninsular promontories of the same island are good examples of small
    ones (<a href="#fig224"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 224</a>). If ice-caps cover a large part of a continent, as some
    of those of the past have done, they are often called <i>continental
      glaciers</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

  <p>Where ice-caps are developed on plateaus whose borders are trenched by
    valleys, ice-tongues from the edge of the ice-cap often extend down
    into the valleys and give rise to one type of <i>valley glacier</i>
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig224">224</a> and <a href="#fig227">227</a>). A second and more familiar type of valley glacier
    occupies mountain valleys, and is the offspring of mountain snow-fields
    (<a href="#fig228"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 228</a>). The former are confined chiefly to high latitudes, and
    are distinguished as <i>polar</i> or <i>high-latitude</i> glaciers
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig227">227</a> and <a href="#fig229">229</a>); the latter are known as <i>alpine</i> glaciers
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig228">228</a> and <a href="#fig230">230</a>). The end and side slopes of polar glaciers
    are, as a rule, much steeper than those of alpine glaciers. When
    a valley glacier descends through its valley to the plain beyond,
    its end deploys, forming a fan (<a href="#fig231"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 231</a>). The deploying ends of
    adjacent glaciers sometimes merge, and the resulting body of ice
    constitutes a <i>piedmont glacier</i> (<a href="#fig232"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 232</a>). At the present
    time, piedmont glaciers are confined to high latitudes. In some
    cases the snow-field that gives rise to a glacier is restricted to
    a relatively small depression in the side of a mountain, or in the
    escarpment of a plateau. In such cases the snow-field and glacier are
    hardly distinguishable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> and the latter descends but little below
    the snow-line. In many cases it does not even enter the narrow valley
    which leads out from the depression occupied by the snow-field. Such a
    glacier is nestled in the face of a cliff, and may therefore be called
    a <i>cliff glacier</i><a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig233">233</a> and <a href="#fig234">234</a>). The snow-field of a
    cliff glacier is sometimes no more than a great snowdrift, accumulated
    through successive years. Cliff glaciers are often as wide as long, and
    are always small, and between them and valley glaciers there are all
    gradations (<a href="#fig235"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 235</a>). Occasionally the end of a valley glacier, or
    the edge of an ice-sheet reaches a precipitous cliff, and the end or
    edge of the ice breaks off and accumulates like talus below. The ice
    fragments may then again become a coherent mass by regelation, and the
    whole may resume motion. Such a glacier is called a <i>reconstructed
    glacier</i>. The precipitous cliffs of the Greenland coast furnish
    illustrations.</p>

  <p>Of the foregoing types of glaciers, the ice-caps far exceed all others
    both in size and importance, while the valley glaciers out-rank, in the
    same respects, the other types; but since the valley glaciers are the
    most familiar type, the general phenomena of glaciers will be discussed
    with primary reference to them.</p>

  <h3>THE GENERAL PHENOMENA OF GLACIERS.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></h3>

  <p><b>Dimensions.—</b>Glaciers which occupy valleys leading down from
    snow-fields sometimes reach the upper parts of the valleys only,
    sometimes extend through them, and sometimes push out on the plain
    beyond.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> In length they range from a fraction of a mile to many
    miles, and though their width is usually much less than their length,
    the reverse is sometimes the case (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig233">233</a>, <a href="#fig234">234</a>, and <a href="#fig235">235</a>). Their
    thickness is usually measured by hundreds of feet rather than by
    denominations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> of other orders, but the variation is great, and exact
    measurements are almost wholly wanting. The minimum thickness is that
    necessary to cause movement, and this varies with the slope, the
    temperature, and other conditions. There is also much variation in the
    thickness in different parts of a glacier. As a rule, it is thinnest in
    its terminal portion, and thickest at some point intermediate between
    this and its source, but nearer the latter than the former. Cliff and
    reconstructed glaciers are comparable in size to the smaller valley
    glaciers. Piedmont glaciers may attain greater size.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig235">
    <img class="illowp77" src="images/fig235.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 235.—A glacier in the Cascades near
    Cascade Pass, Wash. A glacier intermediate between a cliff glacier and
    a valley glacier. (Willis, <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>An ice-cap is theoretically thickest at its center and thins away to
    its borders, but its actual dimensions are influenced by the topography
    on which it is developed. The Greenland ice-cap is known to rise about
    9000 feet above the sea, and it probably reaches considerably higher
    than this in the unexplored center of its broad dome. The height of the
    land surface beneath is unknown, but it is unlikely that it averages
    half this amount, and hence the ice is probably 5000 feet or more thick
    in the center. There is reason to think that it is much thicker in
    Antarctica.</p>

  <p><b>Limits.—</b>The ice of a glacier is always moving forward
    (neglecting temporary halts), but the <i>end</i> of a glacier may be
    retreating, advancing or remaining stationary, according as the rate
    of wastage is greater, less, or just equal to the forward movement of
    the ice. The position of the lower end of the glacier is therefore
    determined by the ratio of movement to wastage. Its upper end is
    generally ill-defined. In a superficial sense, it is the point where
    the ice emerges from the snow-field; but the lower limit of the
    snow-field is often ill-defined, and in any case is not the true upper
    limit of the glacier, since there must be movement from the granular
    mass of ice beneath the snow to make up for the waste below, and the
    moving ice beneath the snow-field which feeds the tongue of ice in the
    valley is just as really a part of the glacier as the more consolidated
    portion in the valley below. If a definite upper limit for an alpine
    glacier is to be named, it should probably be the <i>Bergschrund</i>, a
    gaping crevasse, or series of crevasses which sometimes open near the
    precipitous slope of the peak or cliff where the snow-field lies. The
    <i>Bergschrund</i> is formed by the moving of the lower part of the
    snow-field away from the portion above.</p>

  <p>The lower end of a glacier is usually free from snow and névé in
    summer, but, traced toward its source, it first becomes covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
    névé, then with snow, and finally merges into the snow-field without
    having ceased to be a glacier. The term glacier is, however, commonly
    used to mean merely the more solid portion outside (below) the névé.</p>

  <p><b>Movement.—</b>The fact of glacier movement is established in various
    ways, the most obvious being by the advance of its lower end. Such
    advance is too slow to be seen from day to day, and is only detected
    when the lower end of the glacier overrides or overturns objects in
    front of it, or moves out over ground previously unoccupied. But even
    when the end of a glacier is not advancing, the movement of the ice may
    be established by means of stakes or other marks set on the surface.
    If the positions of these marks relative to fixed points on the sides
    of the valley be determined, they are found after a time to have moved
    down the valley. Rows of stakes or lines of stones set across a glacier
    in the upper, middle and lower portions have revealed many facts
    concerning the movement of the ice.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the middle of a valley glacier moves more rapidly
    than its sides (<a href="#fig236"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 236</a>), but in some cases, especially in large
    glaciers, there are found to be two or more main lines of movement,
    with belts of lesser movement between. The top of a glacier moves, on
    the whole, more rapidly than the bottom, though the observations made
    do not show that the rate of movement diminishes regularly downward,
    and it probably does not so diminish in many cases. In Switzerland,
    where the glaciers have been studied more carefully than elsewhere,
    the determined rates of movement range from one or two inches to four
    feet or more per day. Some of the larger glaciers in other regions
    move more rapidly, but it does not follow that large glaciers always
    move faster than small ones. The Muir glacier of Alaska has been found
    to move seven feet or more per day,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and some of the glaciers of
    Greenland have been found to move, in the summer time, 50, 60, or even
    more feet per day. A single estimate as high as 100 feet per day has
    been made; but these high rates have been observed only where the ice
    of a large inland area crowds down into a comparatively narrow fjord,
    and debouches into the sea, and then only in the summer. In the case of
    the glacier with the highest recorded rate of summer movement, 100 feet
    per day, the advance was only 34 feet at about the same place in April.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

  <p>The <i>average</i> movement of the border of the inland ice of
    Greenland is very small. Rink says that “between 62° and 68° 30′, the
    edge of the inland ice is almost stationary for a remarkably long
    distance.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The observations of the authors between 77° and 78°
    were of like import. Probably the average movement of the border of the
    Greenland ice-cap is less than one foot a week.</p>

  <p><b>Conditions affecting rate of movement.—</b>The rate of glacier
    movement appears to depend on (1) the depth of the moving ice; (2) the
    slope of the surface over which it moves; (3) the slope of the upper
    surface of the ice; (4) the topography of the bed over which it passes;
    (5) the temperature; and (6) the amount of water which falls upon it or
    is carried to it by the drainage of its surroundings, in addition to
    that produced by the melting of the glacier itself. Great thickness,
    a steep slope, much water, smoothness of bed, and a high (for ice)
    temperature favor rapid movement. Since some of these conditions,
    notably temperature and amount of water, vary with the season, the rate
    of movement for any given glacier is not constant throughout the year.
    Other conditions, especially the first of those mentioned above, vary
    through longer periods of time, and occasion periodic variations in the
    rate of movement.</p>

  <p>Since the volume of ice concerned influences the rate of movement,
    anything which changes the volume affects the rate. An excess of
    snowfall with favorable conditions for its preservation for a period
    of years, increases the volume of ice, and tends to accelerate its
    movement. A deficiency in snowfall, or in its preservation, as from
    high average temperature or from aridity, diminishes the quantity of
    ice, and so retards the movement. An acceleration of velocity causes
    the ice to move down the valley farther before being melted, that
    is, causes the end of the glacier to advance, while a decrease of
    velocity produces the opposite effect. As a matter of fact, the lower
    ends of glaciers advance for a period of years and then retreat, to
    advance again at a later time.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Observation has shown that the
    periods of advance follow a succession of years when the snowfall
    has been heavy and the temperature low, while the periods of retreat
    follow a succession of years when the snowfall has been light and the
    temperature above the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>average. The periods of advance and retreat lag
    behind the periods of heavy and light snowfall respectively, by some
    years, and a long glacier responds less promptly than a short one.
    Present knowledge seems to point to a period of 35 to 40 years as the
    time within which a cycle of fluctuation, that is, an advance and a
    retreat, takes place.</p>

  <p>A declining upper surface is essential to glacier motion. There are
    short stretches where this is not the case, and indeed there are
    particular places where the upper surface slopes backward.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> This
    may occur where the ice is pushed up over a swell in its bed, or is
    crowded up against any considerable obstacle; but such cases are no
    more than local exceptions, and do not militate against the truth of
    the general statement that the upper surface of a glacier declines
    in the direction of motion. A declining <i>lower</i> surface is less
    necessary. In the case of valley glaciers, the bed does, as a rule,
    decline in the direction of motion, but that there are local exceptions
    is shown by the deep basins in rock which such glaciers often leave
    behind them when they retreat. In the great continental glaciers of
    recent geologic times, the ice frequently moved up slopes for scores,
    and even hundreds of miles; but in all such cases, the upper surface
    must have declined in the direction of movement. With a given thickness
    of ice, the greater the decline of its lower surface in the direction
    of motion, the more rapid its progress. A rough bed, or a crooked
    course retards the motion of a glacier, while a smooth bottom and a
    straight course facilitate it.</p>

  <p>Slope, roughness of bed, and volume affect the movement of glaciers
    somewhat as they affect the movement of rivers. The temperature of
    the water, on the other hand, has little effect on the flow of a
    river so long as it remains unfrozen; but the effect of temperature
    on the motion of ice is most important. In many cases, indeed, the
    temperature, together with the water that is incidental to it, seems
    to be the chief factor in determining the rate of movement. The way in
    which its effects are felt will be discussed later.</p>

  <p><b>Likenesses and unlikenesses of glaciers and rivers.—</b>Many of the
    characteristics of a valley glacier may be understood from the study of
    the accompanying figure (<a href="#fig237"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 237</a>) of the White (Alaska) glacier. From
    this figure it will be seen that the glacier is an elongate river-like
    body, following the curves of the valley in stream-like fashion. It
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>has its origin in the snows collected on the mountain heights seen
    in the distance, and it works its way down the valley in a manner
    which, in the aggregate, is similar to the movement of a stiff liquid.
    The likeness to a river extends to many details. Not only does the
    center move faster than the sides, and the upper part faster than the
    bottom, as in the case of streams, but the movement is more rapid in
    constricted portions of the valley and slower in the broader parts.
    These and other likenesses, some of which are apparent rather than
    real, have given origin to the view that glacier ice moves like a stiff
    viscous liquid.</p>

    joining a larger glacier (foreground), Alaska. (Reid.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>But while the points of likeness between glaciers and rivers are
    several, their differences are at least equally numerous and
    significant. The trains of débris on the surface (the dark bands in the
    illustration), like the central currents of streams, pass nearer the
    projecting points of the valley walls and farther from the receding
    bends; but beyond this point the analogy fails, for the trains of
    débris on the ice do not conform in detail to the courses of the
    currents of a winding stream, nor is there evidence of the rotatory
    motion that characterizes river water. Furthermore, the glacier is
    readily fractured, as the numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> gaping crevices on many glaciers
    show. The crevasses are sometimes longitudinal, sometimes transverse,
    and sometimes oblique. In the case of Arctic glaciers, longitudinal
    crevassing is especially conspicuous.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><i>Crevasses</i> appear to be developed wherever there is appreciable
    tension, and the causes of this tension are many. An obvious cause is
    an abrupt increase of gradient in the bed (<a href="#fig238"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 238</a>). If the change
    of gradient be considerable, an ice-fall or cascade results, and the
    ice may be greatly riven (<a href="#fig228"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 228</a>). Below the cascade, the surface
    may bristle with wedges and pinnacles of ice (séracs, <a href="#fig239"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 239</a>).
    Transverse crevices at the margin sometimes appear to be the result
    of the tension developed on a curve. Oblique crevices on the surface
    near the sides are commonly ascribed to the tension between the
    faster-moving center and the slower-moving margins, and in like manner
    crevasses that rise obliquely from the bottoms are attributed to the
    tension between the faster-moving portions above and the slower-moving
    portions below. All these crevasses indicate strains to which a liquid,
    whose pressures are equal in all directions, does not offer a close
    analogy. Longitudinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> crevasses may affect both the river-like part
    of a glacier and its deploying end, and are the result of tension
    developed by movement within the ice itself, to which, again, rivers
    offer no analogy. Somewhat similar cracks develop in the outer crust
    of asphalt, when a mass of it is allowed to stand and spread; but in
    this case there is evaporation of the volatile ingredients, giving to
    the outer part relative rigidity and brittleness, while the inner part
    remains more fluent. The analogy is therefore not perfect and probably
    not really illustrative. The crevices may be narrow or wide, and both
    narrow and wide may be found in the same glacier. The narrow crevices
    that never open much are the most significant, as they show that very
    little stretching is needed to satisfy the tension. The opening of a
    gaping crevice is sometimes the work of weeks, and, in the slow-moving
    glaciers of high latitudes, sometimes the work of successive seasons.
    All this shows that the glacier is a very brittle body, incapable of
    resisting even very moderate strains brought to bear upon it very
    slowly. Had the ice even moderate ductility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> it would adapt itself to
    tension brought to bear upon it so slowly as are many of the tensions
    which produce crevassing. In its behavior under tension therefore a
    glacier is notably unlike a river.</p>

  <h3>SURFACE FEATURES.</h3>

  <p><b>Topography.—</b>Many of the minor irregularities of the surface of
    a glacier are the result of crevassing. After the ice is crevassed,
    the sun’s rays and the air which has been warmed by them penetrate
    the openings and melt the ice. The melting is most rapid at the
    top, and decreases downward. The result is that the sections of ice
    between adjacent crevasses are narrowed into wedges. If there be
    cross-crevassing, as is common, points instead of wedges result. As the
    sort of surface shown in <a href="#fig239"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 239</a> develops, any débris which was on the
    ice slides into the crevices, and the upper surface becomes clean.</p>

  <p>Where ice is crevassed transversely, and where melting is not rapid,
    the crevasses may close as the ice moves forward, and the regelation
    of adjoining faces heals the rents in the surface. Even in this case,
    however, the surface is likely to be more or less undulating because of
    the waste on the sides of the crevices before they are closed. After
    regelation, surface ablation tends to obliterate the protuberances.</p>

  <p>The topography of the surface of the ice is affected by other
    conditions. All parts of the surface of the ice are not equally
    compact, and the least compact portions melt most rapidly, giving rise
    to depressions, while the more solid parts occasion protuberances.
    Both depressions and protuberances may be regular or irregular in form
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig240">240</a> and <a href="#fig241">241</a>). Undulations of the bed often show themselves
    in the surface of the ice as suggested by <a href="#fig242"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 242</a>. In such cases,
    ponds or lakelets sometimes accumulate on the surface of the ice. The
    topography of the ice in such cases seems to show that the ice is
    forced up slope.</p>

  <p><b>Surface moraines.—</b>The surface of a glacier is often affected
    by débris of one sort or another, and this also influences its
    topography. The débris is sometimes disposed in the form of belts
    or <i>moraines</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig237">237</a>, <a href="#fig243">243</a>). The surface moraines may be
    <i>lateral</i>, <i>medial</i>, or <i>terminal</i>. A <i>lateral
    moraine</i> is any considerable accumulation of débris in a belt on the
    side of a glacier. A <i>medial moraine</i> is a similar accumulation
    at some distance from the margins, but not necessarily in or near the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>middle. There may be several medial moraines on one glacier, in which
    case some of them may be far from the center. In alpine glaciers,
    the <i>surface terminal</i> moraine is less well-defined; in polar
    glaciers it often connects two lateral moraines, making a loop roughly
    concentric with the terminus of the glacier.</p>

    melting of veined ice. End of small glacier south of Forno hut,
    Engadine, Switzerland. (Reid.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Besides the surface moraines, which represent belted aggregations of
    débris, there may be scattered bowlders and bits of rock of various
    sizes on the ice, and, in addition to the coarse material, there is
    often some dust which has been blown upon the ice.</p>

  <p><b>Relief due to surface débris.—</b>The débris on the ice affects its
    topography by influencing the melting of the subjacent and adjacent
    ice. The rock débris absorbs heat more readily than the ice. A small
    and thin piece of stone lying on the ice is warmed through by the
    sun’s rays, and, melting the ice beneath, sinks, just as a piece of
    black cloth on snow will sink because of the increased melting beneath
    it. Though a good absorber of heat, rock is a poor conductor, and so
    the lower surface of a large mass of stone is not notably warmed. The
    ice beneath it is protected from the direct rays of the sun, and is
    therefore melted more slowly than that around it. The result is that
    the bowlder presently stands on a protuberance of ice (<a href="#fig244"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 244</a>). When
    its pedestal becomes high, the oblique rays of the sun and the warm air
    surrounding it cause it to waste away, and the capping bowlder falls.
    In high latitudes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span> the great obliquity of the rays sometimes allows
    them to strike under isolated bowlders. In this case, they are warmed
    from below, and thus aid rather than hinder the melting of the ice.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig242">
    <img class="illowp90" src="images/fig242.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 242.—Irregular surface due to uneven
    bottom. Bowdoin glacier, Inglefield Gulf, North Greenland. The dark
    patches near the left margin of the glacier are lakelets in basins
    produced by the upward bending of the ice as it overrides an elevation
    in its bed. The figure also shows a depressed medial moraine.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The same principles apply to the moraines. A thin bowlder moraine in
    high latitudes is sometimes sunk below the surface (<a href="#fig242"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 242</a>). Usually,
    however, a medial moraine protects the ice beneath from melting, and
    occasions the development of a ridge of ice beneath itself. As the ice
    on either side is then lowered by ablation, the moraine matter of the
    medial belt tends to slide down on either hand. The same is true of the
    lateral moraines. So far does this spreading go, that in some cases the
    lower end of a glacier is completely covered with the débris which has
    spread from the medial and lateral moraines. Examples of this may be
    seen in almost any region of abundant, long, alpine glaciers.</p>

    moraines, characteristic profile, etc.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Dust-wells.—</b>The wind-blown dust sometimes gives rise to peculiar
    topographic features of small size. The dust is not distributed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
    wind with absolute equality, and the surface drainage of the ice tends
    to aggregate it. Every dust particle acts like a small stone, and where
    aggregations of dust occur, they melt their way down into the ice,
    developing holes or “dust-wells” (<a href="#fig245"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 245</a>). These wells rarely reach a
    depth of more than a few inches, but they may be so numerous that the
    pedestrian is obliged to watch his steps. This is especially true near
    the edge of the large ice-caps. It is evident that the depth of these
    dust wells must be slight, for so soon as they are deep enough to cut
    off the sun’s rays from the dust at the bottom, the deepening ceases.
    Other things being equal, they are deeper in low latitudes than in high.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Débris below the surface.—</b>The lower part of a glacier, as
    well as the upper, carries rock débris. This débris is sometimes so
    abundant, especially near the ends and edges of the ice, that it is
    difficult to locate the bottom of the glacier; for between the moving
    ice which is full of débris, and the stationary débris which is full
    of ice, there seems to be a nearly complete gradation. The débris in
    the lower part of arctic glaciers, and to some extent of others, is
    often disposed in thin sheets sandwiched in between layers of clean
    ice. These débris sheets are often numerous and usually discontinuous,
    though groups of such sheets often persist for considerable distances.
    Débris also occurs to some extent in the ice well above its base. It is
    sometimes in belts, as seen in section, and sometimes in bunches. These
    various relations are illustrated by <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig227">227</a>, <a href="#fig229">229</a>, and <a href="#fig246">246–249</a>.</p>

  <p>Another characteristic of the basal débris-laden part of some glaciers
    is the <i>foliation of the ice</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig248">248</a>, <a href="#fig249">249</a>, etc.). This is
    especially well shown in the arctic glaciers, the ends and sides of
    which have steep or vertical faces. The foliation is best developed
    in the débris zone, though often shown above. The foliation is
    sometimes minute, consisting of layers of clean ice, an inch or less
    in thickness, separated by mere films of earthy matter. In extreme
    cases there are a score or more of laminæ within a foot. Locally, and
    especially where débris is abundant, the laminæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> are much contorted.
    This is seen both in section (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig248">248</a> and <a href="#fig249">249</a>) and on the surface
    (<a href="#fig250"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 250</a>).</p>

  <h3>TEMPERATURE, WASTE, AND DRAINAGE.</h3>

  <p>The temperature of glacier ice may range downward from the freezing
    point of water much as other solid portions of the earth’s surface,
    but it has a fixed upper limit at 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> (0° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>) because all the
    heat it receives tending to raise its temperature above that point, is
    converted into the latent form by the melting of the ice. The range of
    temperature is greatest at the surface, where it varies from 32° in the
    summer, to the coldest temperature of the region where the ice occurs.
    Beneath the surface the range of temperature is more restricted, and
    increasingly so with increasing depth.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

  <p>The variation of temperature at the surface is due primarily to the
    varying temperature of the air. During the cold season, a wave of
    low temperature (the <i>winter</i> wave), starting at the surface,
    penetrates the ice, and during the warm season a wave of higher
    temperature (the <i>summer</i> wave) takes the same course. The day
    and night waves and other minor variables are, for present purposes,
    negligible.</p>

      glacier (East glacier), showing position of débris and structure of the ice.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The winter wave.—</b>There are but few observations on the internal
    temperatures of glaciers during the winter season, but it seems certain
    that the winter wave diminishes rapidly downward and dies out below,
    much as does the winter wave which affects land surfaces not covered
    with ice. Conduction alone considered, the temperature of the ice where
    the cold wave dies out, should correspond, approximately, to the mean
    annual temperature of the region, provided that temperature is below
    the melting point of ice.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

  <p>Assuming that in the high altitudes and high latitudes where glaciers
    abound, the temperature of the surface may average about −12° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>
    (about −25° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>) for the winter half of the year, which is about the
    case for north Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Franz Josef Land, and that
    the conductivity of the ice in the C. G. S.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> system is .005,
    the temperature would be lowered appreciably only about 40 feet
    below the surface at the close of the winter period, conduction only
    being considered. How far the internal temperature may be influenced
    by air forced through the ice by winds and by variations of the
    barometer is not known and cannot well be estimated. The wave of low
    temperature descending from the surface in winter would probably become
    inappreciable before reaching a depth of 60 feet. At this depth the
    temperature should be about 15° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>—the mean annual temperature of
    the region.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

    surface. A small glacier south of Forno hut, Engadine, Switzerland. (Reid.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The summer wave.—</b>The warm wave follows the analogy of the summer
    wave of ice-free land surfaces much less closely. This is because of
    the low melting temperature of ice as compared with other forms of
    solid earth-matter. On this account the summer wave is bi-fold. The
    one part travels downward by conduction, the other by the descent of
    water; the one has to do primarily with the temperature before the
    melting-point of ice is reached; the other, with the temperature after
    that point is reached; the first conforms measurably to the warm wave
    affecting other solid earth-matter, while the second is governed by
    special laws. After the surface portion of the ice is brought to the
    melting temperature, the additional heat which it receives melts the
    ice and is transformed from <i>sensible</i> into <i>potential</i> heat.
    Ice charged with water is <i>potentially</i>, but not <i>sensibly</i>,
    warmer than ice which has just reached the melting temperature.</p>

  <p>The warm wave of conduction dies out below like the cold wave. The
    warm wave descending by the flow of water stops where the freezing
    temperature of water is reached. In regions where the average
    temperature is below freezing, the water-wave does not descend so far
    as the wave of conduction, since the latter descends below the zone
    where the melting temperature is found.</p>

  <p>The foregoing considerations warrant the generalization that glaciers
    normally consist of two zones (1) an outer or upper zone of fluctuating
    temperature, and (2) an under zone of nearly constant temperature. The
    under zone obviously does not exist where the thickness of the ice is
    less than the thickness of the zone of fluctuating temperature. This
    may be the case in very thin glaciers in very cold regions, and in the
    thin ends and edges of all glaciers.</p>

  <p><b>The temperature of the bottom.—</b>The internal heat of the earth
    is slowly conducted to the base of a glacier where it melts the ice at
    the estimated average rate of about one-fourth of an inch per year.
    The temperature of melting is a little below 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> since pressure
    lowers the melting-point at the rate of .0133° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> (.0075° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>) for
    one atmosphere of pressure. At the bottom of a mile of ice therefore
    the melting temperature is about 30.2° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> (−1° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>) It is probable
    that in all thick glaciers the temperature of the bottom is constantly
    maintained at the melting-point. This may be indicated by the streams
    which issue from beneath glaciers during the winter, though this
    criterion is hardly decisive since the issuing waters may be derived
    partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span> or wholly from the rock beneath. In glaciers or in parts of
    glaciers so thin as to lie wholly within the zone of fluctuating
    temperature, the temperature of the bottom is obviously not constant.</p>

  <p><b>Temperature of the interior of the ice.—</b>The variation of
    temperature of the surface of a glacier has already been shown to lie
    between a maximum of 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> and the minimum temperature of the
    region where the glacier occurs. Lower, in the zone of fluctuating
    temperature, the variation is less, and where the zone of fluctuating
    temperature passes into the zone of constant temperature, variation
    ceases. The thickness of the zone of fluctuating temperature varies
    with the temperature of the region where the glacier occurs, being
    greatest where the winters are coldest. In the case of all glaciers
    except thin ones in very cold regions, the temperatures within the
    zone of constant temperature range from the mean annual temperature
    of the region at the top of the zone (provided this is not above the
    melting-point of ice at this depth) to the melting temperature of the
    ice at the bottom. Within these limits the range may be great or slight.</p>

  <p>If we consider only the effects of the external seasonal temperatures
    and the internal heat of the earth, it appears that all the ice in
    the zone of constant temperature in the lower end of a typical alpine
    glacier should have a constant melting temperature, for the average
    temperature of regions where the ends of such glaciers occur is usually
    above 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, and this determines a temperature of 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> (or a
    little less) at the top of the zone, while a melting temperature is
    maintained at the bottom by the earth’s interior heat. In thin glaciers
    of very cold regions, where the zone of constant temperature has
    relatively slight thickness, the low temperature descending from the
    surface may so far overcome the effect of internal heat as to keep the
    bottom of the ice at a freezing temperature. In all other cases, the
    ice at the bottom of the under zone has a melting temperature, while
    that above is probably colder.</p>

  <p>In the higher altitudes and in the polar latitudes where glaciers
    are chiefly generated, the mean annual temperature of the surface is
    usually below the melting-point of ice. Here the temperature of the
    ice between the top and bottom of the zone of constant temperature
    must, on the average, be below the melting-point, unless heat enough
    is generated in the interior of the ice to offset the effect of the
    temperature above. For example, where the mean annual temperature is
    20°<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span> <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> or lower, as in middle Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Franz
    Josef Land, and at certain high altitudes in more southerly latitudes,
    the mean temperature in the zone of constant temperature should range
    from 20° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> at the top to 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> (or a little less) below;
    i.e., it should average about 6° below the melting-point. Under these
    conditions, all the ice in the zone of constant temperature, except
    that at its bottom, must be permanently below the melting-point, but it
    is perhaps worthy of especial note that much of it is but little below.
    In alpine glaciers the part of the ice affected by this constant low
    temperature (below freezing) is presumed to be chiefly that which lies
    beneath the snow-fields. In polar glaciers the low temperature probably
    prevails beneath the surface, not only throughout the great ice-caps,
    but also in the marginal glaciers which descend from them.</p>

  <p>From these theoretical considerations we may deduce the generalization
    that in the zone of constant temperature <i>within the area of glacial
    growth</i>, the temperature of the ice is generally <i>below</i> the
    melting-point, while <i>within the area of wastage</i>, the temperature
    of the corresponding zone is generally <i>at</i> the melting-point.</p>

  <p><b>Compression and friction as causes of heat.—</b>The foregoing
    conclusions are somewhat modified by dynamic sources of heat. The
    compression arising from gravity, and the friction developed where
    there is motion, are causes of heat. Since friction occurs only when
    motion takes place, the heat which it generates is secondary and
    may, for present purposes, be neglected. Compression not only lowers
    the melting-point slightly, but it <i>produces heat at the point of
    compression</i>. Where the ice is granular, the compression, due to
    weight, takes place at the contacts of the grains. At intermediate
    points the pressure tends to cause them to bulge, and this has the
    effect of lowering the temperature of the bulging points. If therefore
    the compression be considerable, the granules may be warmed to the
    melting-point where they press each other, while at other points their
    temperature may be lower. In this case melting will take place at the
    points of compression, and the moisture so produced will be transferred
    to the adjacent parts of the granule and immediately refrozen. Melting
    at the points of compression would result in some yielding of the mass,
    and in some shifting of the pressure to new points where compression
    and melting would again take place. Thus the melting, the refreezing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
    and the attendant movement might go on until the limits of the power
    of gravity in this direction were reached. From considerations already
    adduced, it appears that the temperature in some parts of every
    considerable body of ice must be such as to permit these changes.
    The heat due to depression and friction may modify the theoretical
    deductions drawn above from atmospheric and internal influences.</p>

  <p><b>Summary.—</b>If the foregoing generalizations be correct, (1) the
    surface of a glacier is likely to be melted during the summer, (2) its
    immediate bottom is slowly melting all the time (unless the thickness
    of the ice be less than the thickness of the zone of annual variation
    or of permanent freezing temperature); (3) its subsurface portion
    <i>in the zone of waste</i> is generally melting, owing to descending
    water, compression, and friction; while (4) its subsurface portion
    <i>in the zone of growth</i> is probably below the melting-point except
    as locally brought to that temperature by compression, friction, and
    descending water, and at the bottom by conduction from the rock beneath.</p>

  <p><b>Movement under low temperature.—</b>Glacier motion will not be
    discussed at this point, but one of the bearings of the preceding
    conclusions on glacier motion may be pointed out. Since there must be
    motion in the area of growth to supply the loss in the area of waste,
    the <i>fundamental</i> cause of motion must be operative in bodies of
    ice the mean temperature of which is below the melting-point, <i>unless
    the dynamic sources of heat are considerable</i>. This fundamental
    cause does not exclude the <i>coöperation</i> of causes that work
    only (1) at the melting temperature, or (2) where the ice is bathed
    with water, or (3) in the plane of contact between wet ice above and
    dry ice below. These may be <i>auxiliary</i> causes which abet the
    fundamental one in producing the more rapid movement of warm seasons,
    or in bringing about the especially rapid movement in situations where
    there is abundant water, or in inducing the shearing which is such a
    remarkable feature of arctic glaciers.</p>

  <p><b>Evaporation.—</b>The ice wastes by evaporation as well as by
    melting, and while the former process is far less important than the
    latter, its results are probably larger than is commonly apprehended.
    One of the most remarkable features of some of the deposits of ancient
    glaciers is the slight evidence they afford of escaping waters. The
    most plausible explanation seems to lie in the supposition that the ice
    was largely wasted by evaporation. This conclusion finds support in
    many places in the presence of a mantle of fine silt over the drift,
    the silt being apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> composed of dust blown upon the ice. It is
    supposed to imply aridity in the region about the ice. If a sufficient
    mantle of dust were spread over the border zone of the ice, and if the
    air were very dry, nearly all the water melted on the surface of the
    ice might be held back by the dust-wells until the water was evaporated
    or absorbed.</p>

      of Olriks Bay, North Greenland.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Drainage.—</b>Some of the water produced by surface melting forms
    little streams on the ice. Sooner or later they plunge into crevasses
    or over the sides and ends of the glacier. In the former case, they
    may melt or wear out well-like passages (moulins) in the ice, and even
    in the rock beneath. Much of the surface water sinks into the ice. Its
    ready penetration is aided by the “dust-wells” which mark the surface
    of many glaciers. In north Greenland wells which contain six or eight
    inches of water at the end of a warm day are often dry in the morning.
    The water has leaked out and passed to lower levels. From these and
    other harmonious observations it is inferred that the superficial
    part of a glacier at least is readily penetrated by water. The depth
    to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span> surface water penetrates is undetermined, but it doubtless
    varies greatly, not only in different glaciers, but in different parts
    of the same glacier, and in the same part at different times. Above
    the line of perennial snow there is little water either from melting
    or from rain, and hence relatively slight penetration. Below the line
    of perennial snow there is much melting and much rain, and here it is
    probable that the water sometimes, perhaps usually, penetrates to the
    bottom of the ice during the melting season, even independently of
    crevasses.</p>

  <p>Once within the glacier, the course of the water is variable.
    Exceptionally it follows definite englacial channels, as shown by
    springs or streams issuing from the ice at some point above its bottom
    (<a href="#fig251"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 251</a>). Oftener it descends or moves forward through the irregular
    openings which the accidents of motion have developed. If it reaches a
    level where the temperature is below its freezing-point, it congeals.
    Otherwise it remains in cavities or descends to the bottom. The water
    produced by melting within the glacier probably follows a similar
    course. So far as these waters descend to the bottom, they join those
    produced by basal melting and issue from the glacier with them. In
    alpine glaciers the waters beneath the ice often unite in a common
    stream in the axis of the valley, and hollow out a tunnel. Thus the
    Rhone is already a considerable stream where it issues from beneath the
    Rhone glacier. In the glaciers of high latitudes, subglacial tunnels
    are less common and the drainage is in streams along the sides of the
    glaciers or through the débris beneath and about them.</p>

  <p>At the end of the glacier, all waters, whether they have been
    superglacial, englacial or subglacial, unite to bear away the silt,
    sand, gravel, and even small bowlders set free from the ice, and
    to spread them in belts along the border of the ice or in trains
    stretching down the valleys below. These are the most common of the
    glacio-fluvial deposits.</p>

  <h3>THE WORK OF GLACIERS.</h3>

  <h4><i>Erosion and transportation.</i></h4>

  <p>The work accomplished by glaciers is distinctive, for while like
    rivers, they abrade the valleys through which they pass, carry forward
    the material which they remove from the surface, and wear, grind, and
    ultimately deposit it, and while their work therefore includes erosion,
    transportation, and deposition, their method is peculiar.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

  <p><b>Getting load.—</b>If the surface on which the snow-field which is
    to become a glacier accumulates be rough and covered with abundant
    rock débris, as such surfaces usually are, the glacier already has a
    basal load when its movement begins, for the snow covers, surrounds,
    and includes such loose blocks of rock as project above the general
    surface and envelops all projecting points of rock within its field.
    When the snow becomes ice and the ice begins to move, it carries
    forward the loose rock already imbedded in it, and tears off the weak
    points of the enveloped rock-projections. It may perhaps also move
    some of the soil and mantle rock of the original surface to which it
    is frozen. In addition to the <i>subglacial</i> load which the glacier
    thus has at the outset, there may be a surface load which has fallen
    on the snow or ice from cliffs above. This is especially true of
    mountain-valley glaciers. If this has been buried by snow and ice it is
    <i>englacial</i>; if it lies on the surface it is <i>superglacial</i>.</p>

  <p>Once in movement, the ice carries away the débris to which it was
    originally attached, and at the same time gathers new load from the
    same area. The new load is acquired partly by the rasping effect of the
    rock-shod ice on its bed, and partly by its rending power which, under
    favorable circumstances, may quarry out considerable blocks of rock.
    This “plucking” process is at its best where the ice passes over cliffs
    of jointed rock or steep-sloped hills.</p>

  <p>As the ice advances into new territory it acquires additional basal
    load, partly by rasping, partly by plucking, partly by freezing to
    it, and partly in other ways. One of these ways may be illustrated by
    the sequence of events when the end of a glacier advances on a very
    large bowlder. As the ice approaches it, the reflection of heat from
    it melts the adjacent edge of the ice, making a slight reëntrant. With
    farther advance, the ice closes in against and around the bowlder, and
    finally carries it along in the bottom of the moving mass. In some
    cases, especially when its advance is rapid, the ice may push débris in
    front of itself. Even where this is the case, the amount of material
    pushed forward is generally slight, partly because the extreme edge of
    the ice often fails to rest on the land in summer, when the movement
    is greatest, being melted from below by the heat of the surface over
    which it is spreading (see <a href="#fig252"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 252</a>), and partly because the earth in
    front of the glacier is frozen during a large part of the year. In this
    condition, the earthy matter has greater resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span> than the ice,
    and the latter rides over it. Superglacial material may be acquired
    during movement by the fall of débris from cliffs, or by the descent of
    avalanches.</p>

    <img src="images/fig252.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 252.—Diagram showing lack of contact of
    the edge of the ice with its bed.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Conditions influencing rate of erosion.—</b>An obstructive attitude
    of the surface toward the movement of the ice is as necessary for
    effective erosion as the movement of the ice itself. Advancing over a
    flat surface, ice ordinarily inflicts but little wear, since there is
    little for it to get hold of. So slight is the abrasive power of ice
    under these conditions that it frequently overrides and buries the soil
    with more or less of its herbaceous vegetation. But while a certain
    measure of roughness of surface is favorable for glacial erosion, the
    topography may be so uneven as to seriously impede the ice. Erosion
    is probably at its maximum, so far as influenced by topography, when
    the roughness of the surface is such as to offer notable catchment for
    the basal ice, but not such as to impede its motion very seriously.
    The amount of relief favorable for the greatest erosion increases with
    increasing thickness of the ice.</p>

  <p>Other conditions which influence erosion by ice are (1) the amount of
    loose or slightly attached débris on the surface, (2) the resistance of
    the rock, (3) the slope of the surface, (4) the thickness of the ice,
    (5) the rate of movement, and (6) the abundance and character of the
    débris which the ice has to work with. The effect of the first five of
    these conditions is evident. The effect of the last is less simple.
    Clean ice passing over a smooth surface of solid rock has little effect
    upon it; but a rock-shod glacier will abrade the same surface notably.
    The effect of this abrasion is shown in the grooves and scratches
    (<i>striæ</i>) which the stones in the bottom of the ice inflict on the
    surface of the rock over which they pass (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig253">253</a>, <a href="#fig255">255</a>, and <a href="#fig256">256</a>).
    At the same time the stones in the ice are themselves worn both by
    abrasion with the bottom, and with one another (<a href="#fig254"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 254</a>). It does not
    follow, however, that the more material in the bottom of the ice the
    greater the erosion it effects; for with increase of débris there may
    be decrease of motion<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>beyond a certain point, the decrease
    of motion seriously interferes with the efficiency of erosion. When any
    considerable thickness of ice at the bottom of the glacier is full of
    débris, this loaded basal portion may approach stagnancy, and the lower
    limit of considerable movement may lie between the loaded ice below
    and the relatively clean ice above. A moderate, but not an excessive
    load of débris is, therefore, favorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span> for great erosion. Something
    depends, too, on the character of the load. Coarse, hard, and angular
    débris is a more effective instrument of erosion than fine, soft, or
    rounded material. The adverse influence of the overloading of the ice
    on its motion has been likened to the stiffening of a viscous liquid by
    the addition of foreign matter, but it may better perhaps be referred
    to the destruction of the granular-crystalline continuity on which
    glacier motion probably depends.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>From the preceding statement, it is evident that erosion is not equally
    effective at all points beneath a glacier. So far as concerns the ice
    itself, erosion is not most effective at the end of a valley glacier,
    or at the edge of an ice sheet, for here the strength of movement is
    too slight and the load too great; nor is the most effective erosion
    at the source or near it, for though the ice may here be thick, the
    movement is slow and the load likely to be slight. Ice conditions only
    being considered, erosion is most effective somewhere between the
    source and the terminus, and probably much nearer the latter than the
    former. The conditions of the surface over which the ice passes may be
    such as to vary the place of greatest erosion widely. Thus in an Alpine
    glacier, erosion may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> most effective at the <i>Bergschrund</i>
    because the slope here favors “plucking.” Here, notable amphitheatres
    (<i>cirques</i>) are sometimes excavated. After the glacier disappears,
    the bottom of the cirque is often seen to contain rock basins (<a href="#fig257"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    257</a>). Glacial cirques abound in mountains where glaciers once existed,
    but from which they have now disappeared. The cirques of the Bighorn
    mountains of Wyoming (<a href="#plate_XIX"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XIX</a>) are examples.</p>

  <p><b>Summary.—</b>In summary it may be said that rapidly moving ice
    of sufficient thickness to be working under goodly pressure, shod
    with a sufficient but not excessive quantity of hard-rock material,
    passing over incoherent or soft formations possessing a topography
    of sufficient relief to offer some resistance, and yet too little to
    retard seriously the progress of the ice, will erode most effectively.</p>

  <p><b>Varied nature of glacial débris.—</b>From its mode of erosion it
    will readily be seen that the bottom of a glacier may be charged with
    various sorts of material. There may be (1) bowlders which the ice has
    picked up from the surface, or which it has broken off from projecting
    points of rock over which it has passed; (2) smaller pieces of rock
    of the size of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span> cobbles, pebbles, etc., either picked up by the ice
    from its bed or broken off from larger masses; (3) the fine products
    (rock-flour) produced by the grinding of the débris in the ice on the
    rock-bed over which it passes, and similar products resulting from the
    rubbing of stones in the ice against one another; and (4) sand, clay,
    soil, vegetation, etc., derived from the surface overridden. Thus the
    materials which the ice carries (<i>drift</i>) are of all grades of
    coarseness and fineness, from large bowlders to fine clay. The coarser
    material may be angular or round at the outset, and its form may be
    changed and its surface striated as it is moved forward. Whether one
    sort of material or another predominates, depends primarily on the
    nature of the surface overridden.</p>

  <p><b>The topographic effects of glacial erosion.—</b>In passing through
    its valley, an alpine glacier deepens and widens its bottom and smooths
    its slopes up to the upper limit of the ice. It tends to change a
    V-shaped valley (<a href="#fig258"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 258</a>) into a U-shaped one (<a href="#fig259"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 259</a>). The change
    in topography at the upper limit of glaciation is often marked (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>

  <p>The deepening of a valley by glacial erosion may throw its tributaries
    out of topographic adjustment. Thus if a main valley is lowered 100
    feet by glacial erosion while its tributary is not deepened, the lower
    end of the latter will be 100 feet above the former when the ice
    disappears. Such a valley is called a <i>hanging valley</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig262">262</a>
    and <a href="#fig263">263</a>). Such valleys are of common occurrence in regions recently
    glaciated, but now ice-free. Examples are common in the western
    mountains of North America and elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Ice-caps which overspread the surface irrespective of valleys and
    hills, tend to reduce the angularities of the surface. Hills and ridges
    are cut down and smoothed (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig264">264</a> and <a href="#fig265">265</a>); but since valleys
    parallel to the direction of movement are deepened at the same time,
    it is doubtful if the relief of the surface is commonly reduced by the
    erosion of an ice-cap.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Fiords.—</b>A glacier descending into the head of a narrow bay may
    gouge out the bay to a very considerable depth, causing its head to
    recede. When the ice finally melts, the bay may be a fiord. Thus have
    arisen the glacial features of many of the fiords of high-latitude
    coasts, and many of the glaciers of those coasts are now making fiords
    (<a href="#fig266"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 266</a>). Fiords also arise in other ways. Coasts indented by fiords
    are likely to be bordered by islands.</p>

  <p><b>The positions in which débris is carried.—</b>As a result of the
    methods by which a glacier becomes loaded, there are three positions
    in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span> the débris is carried: (1) the basal or subglacial, (2)
    the englacial, and (3) the superglacial. The material picked up or
    rubbed off from the surface over which the ice moves is normally
    carried forward in the base of the ice; while that which falls on the
    surface is usually carried in the form of surface moraines. In the
    former position the drift is basal; in the latter, superglacial. It is
    doubtful if much débris is moved along beneath (that is, strictly below
    the bottom of) the ice, though the movement of the latter would have a
    tendency to drag or urge along with it the loose material of its bed.
    If drift were carried forward in such positions, it would be strictly
    <i>subglacial</i>.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The basal load of a glacier is constantly being mixed with new
    accessions derived from ground over which the ice is passing, and
    this admixture tells the story of the work done by the bottom of the
    ice. The englacial and superglacial material, on the other hand, is
    normally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> borne from the place of origin to the place of deposition
    without such intermixture. It is a case of “local” versus “through”
    transportation.</p>

  <p><b>Transfers of load.—</b>While the origin of the load usually
    determines its position, exceptions and complications arise from the
    transfer of load from one position to another, and from the gradation
    of one horizon into another.</p>

  <p>Most of the débris gathered by ice is acquired at its bottom. While
    such material is basal <i>at the outset</i>, some of it may find itself
    above the bottom a little later. Thus when ice passes over a hill (<a href="#fig267"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    267</a>) the bottom of the ice rends débris from the top of the hill. When
    it descends from one level to another there is a similar result (<a href="#fig268"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    268</a>). To the lee of the hill the ice from either side may close in
    under that which came over the top, in which case the débris derived
    from the top of the hill by the bottom of the overriding ice will be
    well up in the ice. It has passed from an initial basal to a subsequent
    englacial position. The change does not usually involve an actual rise
    of the material,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> but rather a decline. If carried upward at all, the
    upward movement is temporary only, and incident to the passage of the
    ice over the hill, or to other local causes. The englacial débris may
    be little or much above the basal zone according to the height of the
    elevation overridden.</p>

  <p>Superglacial débris may obviously become englacial by falling into
    crevasses or by being carried down by descending waters. Either
    superglacial or englacial débris may become basal by the same means.</p>

  <p>From their form and position, there is less ice-free land in immediate
    association with ice-caps than with valley glaciers. Furthermore, the
    ice-free land about the borders of an ice-cap is less likely to be in
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> form of cliffs above it. As a result, the surfaces of ice-caps are
    comparatively clean, except at their edges where the ice is thin.</p>

  <p>Englacial material may become superglacial by surface ablation. In this
    case the drift does not rise, but melting brings the surface of the ice
    down to its level. This occurs chiefly at the end or edge of the ice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
    where the surface melting is greatest. Englacial débris, especially
    that near the bottom, may also become basal by the melting of the
    bottom of the ice.</p>

  <p>Englacial material plucked or rasped from an elevation over which the
    ice has passed is liable to be disposed in a longitudinal belt in
    the ice in the lee of the elevation itself. By surface ablation this
    material may reach the surface at some point below its source, and
    be disposed as a medial moraine. Such a moraine has an origin very
    different from that of a medial moraine formed by the junction of two
    lateral moraines of superglacial origin.</p>

  <p>Much less in the natural order of things is the transfer of material
    from a basal to an englacial and from an englacial to a superglacial
    position by upward movement of the débris itself. Such transfer is
    remarkable because the specific gravity of rock is from two and a half
    to three times as great as that of ice, so that its normal tendency is
    to sink.</p>

  <p>In arctic glaciers, and probably in others, some material which has
    been basal becomes englacial by being sheared forward over ice in front
    of it. So far as observed this takes place chiefly where the ice in
    front of the plane of shearing lies at a lower level than that behind,
    as where the surface of an upland falls off into a valley, or where
    a boss of rock shelters the ice in its lee from the thrust of the
    overriding ice (<a href="#fig268"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 268</a>).</p>

    of the layers of ice at the end of an arctic glacier as seen in
    end-section. The bottom line represents sea level.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>At the borders of arctic glaciers the lower layers are not infrequently
    upturned, as shown in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig269">269</a> to <a href="#fig272">272</a>. Where the layers turn up at
    the end of a glacier (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig269">269</a> and <a href="#fig270">270</a>), basal and englacial débris
    is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span> carried to the surface by actual upward movement, and a terminal
    moraine or a series of terminal moraines sometimes aggregated <i>where
    the upturned layers of ice outcrop at the surface</i> (<a href="#fig271"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 271</a>). That
    the material of these moraines was originally basal is abundantly
    demonstrated by the bruised and scratched condition of the bowlders
    and pebbles, and sometimes by the nature of the material itself. For
    example, in two cases in North Greenland where glaciers descend into
    the heads of shallow bays and move forward on their bottoms, moraines
    formed by the upturning of the layers were seen to contain <i>abundant
    molluscan shells derived from the bottom of the bay</i>. The upturning
    sometimes affects the side-edges of ice-tongues (<a href="#fig272"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 272</a>) as well as
    their ends, and the material thus brought to the surface gives origin
    to lateral moraines altogether different in origin from the lateral
    moraines formed by the falling of débris upon the glaciers. Sometimes
    also there is an upturning of the ice along a longitudinal zone well
    back from the lateral margins (<a href="#fig273"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 273</a>), and the material so borne
    to the surface in such a zone gives rise to a moraine resembling the
    medial moraine formed by the union of lateral moraines, but of wholly
    different origin.</p>

    as 272, where the structure is more complex. The bottom line of the
    figure represents sea level.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The phenomenon of upturning here referred to has been observed only at
    or near the terminus of the ice, and is perhaps due in most part to the
    resistance of frozen morainic or other material beneath and in front of
    the edge. To this should probably be added the effect of the increased
    rigidity of the ice at its borders, due to the low external temperature
    during the larger part of the year, while the interior, with its
    higher temperature, remains more fluent. But even this probably leaves
    the explanation inadequate. In not a few instances the upturning is
    associated with a notable <i>thickening</i> of the layers toward their
    edges (<a href="#fig274"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 274</a>). This suggests that perhaps there is an exceptional
    growth of the granular crystals of the ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span> near the edge of the
    layers, owing to the penetration of the surface-waters which are much
    more abundant at the borders than elsewhere, and which in the arctic
    glaciers probably do not penetrate deeply before they reach a freezing
    temperature.</p>

  <p><b>Wear of drift in transit.—</b>Drift carried at the bottom of the
    ice is subject to notable wear. The materials in transportation abrade
    one another and are abraded by the bed over which they pass. Englacial
    drift is subject to less wear because it is commonly more scattered.
    Superglacial drift is worn little or none while it lies on the surface
    of the ice; but in so far as superglacial or englacial drift is derived
    from the basal load, it may show the same evidences of wear as the
    basal drift itself. Superglacial drift often reveals its history in
    this way.</p>

  <h4><i>Deposition of the Drift.</i></h4>

  <p>1. <b>Beneath the body of the ice.—</b>During the advance of a glacier,
    deposition may take place both beneath the body of the ice and beneath
    its end and edges. Deposition beneath the body of the ice is liable to
    take place wherever the topography favors lodgment, or wherever the ice
    is overloaded. The topography favoring deposition is much the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> same as
    that favoring erosion, but the two processes are not favored at the
    same point. Erosion is greatest on the “stoss” side of an obstruction
    (the side against which the ice advances), and deposition on the lee
    side. The ice is likely to be overloaded (1) just beyond a place where
    conditions have favored the gathering of a heavy load, and (2) where
    the ice is rapidly thinning. On the whole, however, the deposition of
    material beneath the main body of a glacier is much more than balanced
    by erosion in the same position.</p>

    <img class="illowp90" src="images/fig275.jpg" alt="">

    Southeast side of McCormick Bay, North Greenland.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>2. <b>At ends and edges of glaciers.—</b>At and near the end of a
    glacier the conditions of deposition are somewhat different. Here
    deposition beneath the ice goes on faster than elsewhere, chiefly
    because of the more rapid melting and the more rapid thinning and
    weakening of the ice. If the end of the glacier be stationary in
    position, drift is being continually brought to it and left there,
    for though the <i>end</i> is stationary, the <i>ice</i> continues to
    move. If the glacier moves forward 500 feet per year, and if its end
    is melted at the same rate, all the débris in the 500 feet of ice
    which has been melted has been deposited, and all except that which
    has been washed away has been deposited at and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> beneath the end of the
    glacier. If the end of the glacier is retreating, the retreat means
    that the waste at the end exceeds the forward movement. If the ice
    advances 300 feet per year, and is melted back 500 feet in the same
    time, all the débris carried by the 500 feet which has been melted
    has been deposited, and largely in the narrow zone (200 feet) from
    which the ice has receded. Even in this case, therefore, there is a
    notable tendency to marginal accumulation. If the end of the glacier
    is advancing 500 feet per year while it is being melted but 300 feet,
    all the drift in the 300 feet melted has been deposited, and chiefly
    at or beneath the immediate margin of the ice. To the marginal and
    sub-marginal accumulations made in this way, the material carried on
    the ice is added whenever the ice is melted from beneath it. This
    addition is sometimes considerable and sometimes meagre. If the edge of
    the ice is without much fluctuation in position, the material dumped
    over its end may take the form of a narrow ridge or bowlder-wall
    (<i>Geschiebe-wall</i>). If a glacier pushes material in front of it,
    this, too, becomes a part of the general terminal aggregation of drift.</p>

  <h3>TYPES OF MORAINES.</h3>

  <p><b>The terminal moraine.—</b>The thick accumulation of drift made at
    the end of a glacier or at the edge of an ice sheet, especially where
    its end or edge is stationary, or nearly stationary, for a considerable
    time, is the <i>terminal moraine</i>. That part of the aggregation
    deposited beneath the ice is sometimes called the <i>lodge</i> moraine
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig275">275</a> and <a href="#fig276">276</a>; see also <a href="#fig235"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 235</a>); that carried on the ice and
    dropped at its edge, the <i>dump</i> moraine; and that pushed before
    the ice, the <i>push</i> moraine. Many moraines marginal to the ice
    appear to be push moraines, when they are really lodge moraines from
    which the ice has withdrawn (<a href="#fig277"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 277</a>). The push moraine can rarely
    be distinguished, and the dump moraine by no means always, after the
    disappearance of the ice.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig277">

    of Kaslo on Lake Kootenai, B. C. A lodge moraine from which the ice
    has withdrawn, giving it the appearance of a push moraine. It is
    possible that the lodge moraine material has been pushed up a little by
    re-advance of the ice. (Atwood.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The ground moraine.—</b>When a glacier disappears by melting, all
    its débris is deposited. All the drift deposited beneath the advancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
    ice and all deposited from the base of the ice during its dissolution
    constitutes the <i>ground moraine</i>. The thickness of the ground
    moraine is notably unequal. In general, it is thicker toward the
    terminus of the glacier and thinner toward its source, but considerable
    portions of a glacier’s bed are often left without débris when the ice
    melts. In general, the terminal moraine is not only thicker, but more
    irregularly disposed than the ground moraine.</p>

  <p><b>The lateral moraines.—</b>The surface lateral moraines of valley
    glaciers are let down on the surface beneath when the ice melts out
    from under them; but the lateral moraines in a valley from which the
    ice has melted are not merely the lateral moraines which were on the
    glacier at a given time. They are often far more massive than any which
    ever existed on the ice itself at any one time (<a href="#fig278"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 278</a>). As a glacier
    retreats, its lateral moraine material is more or less bunched. Thus if
    the ice advances 200 feet while its end is being melted back 300 feet,
    the lateral moraines on the 300 feet melted are concentrated into 100
    feet, as they are delivered on to the land by the melting of the ice
    from beneath. If the retreat of the end of a glacier be very slow, the
    bunching may be great. But even this cannot explain the massiveness of
    some lateral moraines. Furthermore, the materials of which many lateral
    moraines are composed are nearly as well worn as those of the ground
    moraine. The massive lateral moraines of which this is true are often
    made up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> chiefly of the drift accumulated beneath the lateral margins
    of the glaciers. This accumulation is the result of the lateral motion
    of the ice from center to side. Such sublateral accumulations are akin
    to terminal moraines. Some of the lateral moraines of ancient valley
    glaciers, such as those of the Uinta, Wasatch, and Bighorn mountains
    are several hundred feet high, and in one case about 1000 feet. In
    northern Italy lateral moraines are said to be 1500 to 2000 feet
    high.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

  </figure>

  <p>Most of the material which was englacial during the transportation
    becomes either subglacial or superglacial before deposition, for it
    ordinarily reaches the bottom or the top of the ice before being
    deposited. Where the ends or edges of a glacier are vertical or nearly
    so, as in the high arctic regions, deposition may take place from the
    englacial position directly.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

  <p><b>Distinctive nature of glacial deposits.—</b>The deposits made by
    glaciers are distinctive. In the first place the ice does not assort
    its material, and bowlders, cobbles, pebbles, sand, and clay are
    confusedly commingled (<a href="#fig279"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 279</a>). In this respect, the deposits of ice
    differ notably from those of water. Furthermore, many stones of the
    drift show the peculiar type of wear which glaciers inflict. They are
    not rounded as the stones carried by rivers, though they are notably
    worn. Many of them have subangular forms with planed and beveled
    faces, the planes being striated and bruised (<a href="#fig254"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 254</a>). The absence
    of stratification, the physical heterogeneity, and the striation
    of at least a part of the stones are among the most distinctive
    characteristics of glacial drift. A not less real though less obvious
    characteristic is the constitution of the fine material, for it is in
    general not the product of rock decay, but of rock grinding. The fine
    material handled by streams (except glacial streams) on the other hand,
    is usually the product of rock decay.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 280.—Roche moutonnée, Victoria Harbor, B.
    C.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Glaciated rock surfaces.—</b>Another distinctive mark which a
    glacier leaves behind it is the character of the surface of the rock
    on which the drift rests. This is generally smoothed by the severe
    abrasion to which it has been subjected, and the smoothed surfaces are
    marked by grooves and striæ, similar to those on the stones of the
    drift (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig255">255</a> and <a href="#fig256">256</a>). Other distinctive features of a glaciated
    area are the rounded bosses of rock (<i>roches moutonnées</i>, <a href="#fig280"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    280</a>; see also surface about the lakes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> <a href="#fig261"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 261</a>), the rock basins, the
    lakes (<a href="#fig261"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 261</a>), ponds, and marshes, and the peculiar topographies
    resulting from the unequal erosion, and the still more unequal
    deposition of the drift. Surface bowlders, often unlike the underlying
    formations of rock, and sometimes in peculiar and apparently unstable
    positions, are still another mark of a glaciated area.</p>

  <h3>GLACIO-FLUVIAL WORK.</h3>

  <p>The constant but unequal waste of glaciers has already been referred
    to. The streams to which this gives rise are usually laden with
    gravel, sand and silt derived from the ice. Since the mud is often
    light-colored, the streams are sometimes described as “milky.” Where
    the amount of material carried is great, much of it is dropped at a
    slight distance from the ice, the coarsest being dropped first. Glacial
    streams are, as a rule, aggrading streams, and therefore develop
    alluvial plains, called <i>valley trains</i> (<a href="#fig281"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 281</a> and <a href="#fig282">282</a>), or
    where they enter lakes (<a href="#fig283"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 283</a>), bays, or other streams, deltas.
    In its transportation, the river-borne drift is assorted; after its
    deposition, it is stratified. True glacial deposits in the upper
    part of a mountain valley are, therefore, often continued below by
    glacio-fluvial deposits derived from the same source.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

  <p>The most common form of such deposit is a <i>valley train</i> (<a href="#fig281"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    281</a>) of glacial wash stretching indefinitely down the valley. The silt,
    sand, and gravel of such trains can usually be distinguished from
    valley deposits of non-glacial origin by the character of the material,
    as much of it is the product of grinding, crushing, and fracture,
    rather than of ordinary surface decay. Its materials are, therefore,
    fresh and often include rock material which, if long exposed at the
    surface, would be decomposed or dissolved.</p>

  <p>Where an ice sheet ends in a broad face, as did the ancient continental
    glaciers, numerous streams flow from it and spread their débris in
    front of the terminal moraine, forming a broad fringing sheet or
    “apron” (<i>outwash plain</i>) along it. Where streams of considerable
    size form tunnels under or in the ice, these may become more or less
    filled with wash, and when the ice melts the aggraded channels appear
    as long ridges of gravel and sand known as <i>eskers</i> (<i>osars</i>
    and <i>serpentine kames</i> and <i>kames</i> of authors. See chapter on
    glacial period). It has been thought that similar ridges are sometimes
    formed in valleys cut in the ice from top to bottom, and even that
    they arise from gravel and sand lodged in superglacial channels. The
    latter at least is probably rare, as the surface streams usually have
    high gradients, swift currents, and smooth bottoms, and hence give
    little opportunity for lodgment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span> In the case of ice-sheets, too, in
    connection with which eskers are chiefly developed, there is usually no
    surface material except at the immediate edge, where the ice is thin
    and its layers upturned.</p>

  <p>At the mouths of ice-tunnels or ice-channels, especially where they
    end against terminal moraines, sands and gravels are liable to be
    bunched in quantity, giving rise, after the adjacent ice has melted, to
    peculiar hills and hollows of the knob-and-basin type. The hills and
    short ridges are known as <i>kames</i> (see glacial period). Subglacial
    streams may leave washed and assorted material in their tracks under
    the ice, and this is sometimes buried under deposits made by the ice
    itself, so that glacio-fluvial and glacial deposits are interbedded.</p>

  <h3>ICEBERGS.</h3>

  <p>When glaciers advance into water, the depth of which approaches their
    thickness, their ends are broken off (<a href="#fig284"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 284</a>), and the detached
    masses float away as icebergs (<a href="#fig285"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 285</a>). Many of the bergs are
    overturned, or at least tilted, as they set sail. If this does not
    happen at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span> the outset, it is likely to occur later as the result of the
    melting and wave-cutting which disturb their equilibrium. The great
    majority of bergs do not travel far before losing all trace of stony
    and earthy débris, but the finding of glacial material in dredgings far
    south of all glaciers shows that they occasionally carry stones far
    from land.</p>

  <h3>THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE AND THE MOVEMENT OF GLACIERS.</h3>

  <p>With the preceding account of glaciers in mind, we may return to a
    closer study of their origin, their intimate structure, and their mode
    of motion. The key to this study is the thesis that a glacier is a mass
    of crystalline rock—the purest and simplest type of crystalline rock
    known—since it is made up of a single mineral of simple composition
    and rare purity, which never appears in a solid state except in the
    crystalline form.</p>

  <p><b>The growth and constitution of a glacier.—</b>The origin and
    history of a glacier is little more than the origin and aggregate
    history of the crystals that compose it. The fundamental conception
    of a glacier is therefore best obtained by tracing the growth of its
    constituent crystals. A basal fact ever to be kept in mind is that
    water in the solid form is always controlled by crystalline forces.
    When it solidifies from the vapor of the atmosphere it takes the form
    of separate crystals (<a href="#fig286"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 286–291</a>). Perfect forms are developed
    only when the flakes fall quietly through a saturated atmosphere
    which allows them to grow as they descend. Under other conditions,
    the crystals are imperfect in growth and are mutilated by impact. But
    however modified, they are always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span> crystals. The molecules are arranged
    on the hexagonal plan, and, as the expansive power of freezing water
    shows, the arrangement is controlled by a strong force. Once the
    definite crystalline arrangement is established, the molecules can be
    displaced only by relatively great force.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig285">
    <img class="illowp90" src="images/fig285.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 285.—An iceberg, west coast of Greenland.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Snow crystals often continue to grow so long as they are in the
    atmosphere; but if they pass through an under-saturated stratum of
    air or a stratum whose temperature is above 32° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, they suffer
    from evaporation or melting. When they reach the ground, the processes
    of growth and decadence continue, and the crystals grow or diminish
    according to circumstances.</p>

  <p>A glacier is a colossal aggregation of crystals grown from snowflakes
    to granules of much greater sizes. The microscopic study of new-fallen
    snow reveals the mode of change from flakes to granules. The slender
    points and angles of the former yield to melting and evaporation more
    than the more massive central portions, and this change probably
    illustrates a law of vital importance. It may often be seen that the
    water melted from the periphery of a flake gathers about its center,
    and if the temperature be right, it freezes there. This is a first
    step toward the pronounced granulation of snow which has lain for some
    time on the ground. If measured systematically from day to day, the
    larger granules taken from beneath the surface of this coarse-grained
    snow are found to be growing. In a series of experiments<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> to
    determine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> the law of growth it was found that when the temperature of
    the atmosphere was above the melting-point the growth was appreciably
    more rapid than when the air was colder, but there was, on the average,
    <i>an increase under all conditions of temperature</i>. A portion of
    this average increase of the larger granules appears to come from the
    diminution and destruction of the smaller ones, for the total number
    of granules steadily diminishes. A portion of the growth doubtless
    comes from the moisture of the atmosphere which penetrates the snow
    and another portion from the moisture derived from surface melting;
    but beneath the surface of a large body of snow the growth of the
    large granules is probably chiefly at the expense of the small ones.
    To follow the process it should be noted that the free surface of
    every granule is constantly throwing off particles of water-vapor
    (evaporation); that the rate at which the particles are thrown off is
    dependent, among other things, on the curvature of the surface, being
    greater the sharper the curve; that the surfaces of the granules are
    at the same time liable to receive and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span> retain molecules thrown from
    other granules, and that, other things being equal, the retention
    of particles also depends on the curvature of the surface, the less
    curved surface retaining more than the sharply curved one. Under these
    laws, it is obvious that the larger granules of smaller curvature will
    lose less and gain more, on the average, than the smaller granules of
    greater curvature. It follows that the larger granules will grow at the
    expense of the smaller. It is also to be noted that, other things being
    equal, small granules melt more readily than large ones, and that where
    the temperature is nicely adjusted between melting and freezing, the
    smaller may lose while the larger gain.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig286">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/fig286_291.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr></span> 286–91.—Snowflakes. (Photographed by W. A. Bentley.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Another factor that enters into the process is that of pressure and
    tension. The granules are compressed at the points of contact and put
    under tension at points not in contact, and the pressure and tension
    are, on the average, likely to be relatively greatest for the smallest
    granules. Tension increases the tendency to evaporation and adds its
    effects to curvature, and the capillary spaces adjoining the points
    of contact probably favor condensation. Ice expands in crystallizing
    and pressure reduces the melting-point, while tension raises it. The
    effect of this is slight (<a href="#Page_276"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 276</a>), and it probably plays little part in
    glacial action, but it is to be correlated with the much more important
    fact that <i>compression produces heat</i> which may raise the
    temperature of the ice to the melting-point, while tension may reduce
    the temperature to or below freezing. There is therefore a tendency for
    the ice to melt at the points of contact and compression, and for the
    water so produced to refreeze at adjacent points where the surface is
    under tension. This process becomes effective beneath a considerable
    body of snow, and here the granules gradually lose the spheroidal
    form assumed in the early stages of granulation and become irregular
    polyhedrons interlocked into a more or less solid mass.</p>

  <p>A third factor is also to be recognized, though its effectiveness is
    unknown. Under severe wind pressure, air penetrates porous bodies
    with appreciable facility. The “breathing” of soils and the curious
    phenomena of “blowing-wells” and “blowing-caves” teach us of the
    effective penetration and extrusion of the air under variations of
    barometric pressure. In the snow-fields, and in the more granular
    portions of glaciers near their heads, the porosity is doubtless
    sufficient to allow of the appreciable penetration of the atmosphere.
    During a part of the time, the probable effect is the condensation
    within the ice of moisture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> from the air, and during another part,
    evaporation from the ice. These alternating processes are attended by
    oscillations of temperature. While the balance between loss and gain
    of substance may be immaterial, the oscillating nature of the process
    and the fluctuations of temperature are probably favorable to granular
    change.</p>

  <p>Whether these processes furnish an adequate explanation of the changes
    or not, the observed fact is that there are all gradations from
    snowflakes and pellets into granular névé, and thence into glacier
    granules (<i>Gletscherkörner</i>), varying in size up to that of
    filberts and walnuts, and even beyond. In coherence, these aggregations
    may vary from the early slightly coherent granular stage, where the
    grains are small and spheroidal, to the ice stage, where the cohesion
    has become strong through the interlocking growths of the large
    granules. Even when the mass has become seemingly solid ice, sufficient
    space is usually left between the granules to give the dispersive
    reflection to light which imparts to glacier ice its distinctive
    whitish color.</p>

  <p><b>The arrangement of the crystal axes.—</b>The most radical difference
    between glacier ice and ice formed directly from water is in the
    arrangement (orientation) of the crystals. In the ice formed on
    undisturbed water, the bases of the crystals are at the surface and
    their principal axes are vertical, as shown by Mügge.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> As they
    grow, the crystal prisms extend downwards. This gives a columnar or
    prismatic structure to the ice, well seen when it is “honeycombed”
    by partial melting. In the glacier, on the other hand, the crystals,
    starting from snowflakes, have their axes turned in various directions
    according to the accidents of their fall; and as the snow develops
    into ice, the principal axes of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>crystals continue to lie in all
    directions. Hence glacier ice, unlike pond ice, cannot usually be split
    along definite planes, except where cleavage planes are subsequently
    developed by extraneous agencies.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig291">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/fig291.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Figures to illustrate the method of deformation of ice crystals.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>While the crystals of a glacier usually have their principal axes in
    various directions, there appears to be a tendency for them to approach
    parallelism in certain positions, especially in the basal parts of a
    glacier near its terminus. Observations on this point are not so full
    and critical as could be desired, but it is probable that the parallel
    orientation is partly general, and due to the vertical pressure of the
    ice, and partly special and local, and connected with the shearing
    planes and foliation.</p>

  <p>The bearing of this partial parallelism of the crystals on shearing
    and foliation is supposed to reside in the fact that a crystal of
    ice is made up of a series of plates arranged at right angles to the
    principal axis of the crystal. These plates may be likened to a pile
    of cards, the principal axis being represented by a line vertical to
    them. If a cube be cut from a large crystal of ice, it will behave much
    like a cube cut from the pile of cards. If the cube be so placed that
    its plates are horizontal (<a href="#fig291"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 291</a><i>a</i>), and if it be rested on
    supports at two edges and heavily weighted in the middle, it will sag,
    the plates sliding slightly over one another so as to give oblique
    ends, but in this case the cube offers considerable resistance to
    deformation. If the cube be so placed that the plates stand on edge,
    each reaching from support to support (<a href="#fig291"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 291</a><i>b</i>), it will offer
    very great resistance to deformation; but if the plates be vertical and
    transverse to the line joining the supports, as in <a href="#fig291"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 291</a><i>c</i>,
    the middle portion will sag under very moderate weighting by the
    sliding of the plates on one another, and in a comparatively short time
    the middle portion may be pushed entirely out, dividing the cube. These
    properties have been demonstrated by McConnel<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and Mügge, and they
    appear to throw light on certain phases of the action of glaciers that
    are most pronounced in their basal parts, and are best illustrated in
    arctic glaciers.</p>

  <h4><i>The Probable Fundamental Element in Glacial Motion.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Melting and freezing.—</b>It has already been shown (<a href="#Page_279"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 279</a>) that
    the initial or fundamental cause of glacial motion must be operative at
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>heads of glaciers where the temperature is lowest and the material
    most loosely granular. In this condition, there is reason to believe
    that motion takes place between the grains, rather than by their
    distortion through the displacement of their laminæ. The fact that the
    granular structure is not destroyed, as it would be by the indefinite
    sliding of the crystal plates over each other, sustains this view. The
    inference is that the gliding planes play a notable rôle in glacial
    movement only in the basal parts of the lower ends of glaciers, where
    the greatest thrusts are developed, and where the granules have become
    largest and most completely interlocked. At the heads of glaciers,
    where motion is initiated, there may be great downward pressure, but
    not vigorous thrusts from behind, and probably only moderate thrusts
    developed within the body itself. There seems therefore no escape
    from the conclusion that the primal cause of glacial motion is one
    which may operate even under the relatively low temperatures, the
    relatively dry conditions, and the relatively granular textures which
    affect the heads of glaciers. These considerations lead to the view
    that movement takes place by the minute individual movements of the
    grains upon one another. While they are in the spheroidal form, as in
    the névé, this would not seem to be at all difficult. They may rotate
    and slide over each other as the weight of the snow increases; but
    as they become interlocked by growth, both rotation and sliding must
    apparently encounter more resistance. The amount of rotary motion
    required of an individual granule is, however, surprisingly small,
    and the meltings and refreezings incident to shifting pressures and
    tensions, and to the growth of the granules, seem adequate to meet
    the requirements. In order to account for a movement of three feet
    per day in a glacier six miles long, the mean motion of the average
    granule relative to its neighbor would be, roundly, ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀ of its
    own diameter per day, or one diameter in 10,000 days; in other words,
    it would <i>change its relations to its neighbors</i> to the extent
    of its diameter in about thirty years. A change of so great slowness
    under the conditions of granular alteration can scarcely be thought
    incredible, or even improbable, in spite of the interlocking which the
    granules may develop. The movement is supposed to be permitted chiefly
    by the temporary passage of minute portions of the granules into the
    fluid form at the points of greatest compression, the transfer of the
    moisture to adjoining points, and its resolidification. The points of
    greatest compression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span> are obviously just those whose yielding most
    promotes motion, and a successive yielding of the points that come in
    succession to oppose motion most (and thus to receive the greatest
    stresses) permits continuous motion. It is merely necessary to assume
    that the gravity of the accumulated mass is sufficient to produce
    the minute temporary liquefaction at the points of greatest stress,
    the result being accomplished not so much by the lowering of the
    melting-point as by the development of heat by pressure.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig292">
    <img class="illowp78" src="images/fig292.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 292.—Portion of the east face of Bowdoin
    glacier, North Greenland, showing oblique upward thrust, with shear.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>This conception of glacial “flowage” involves only the <i>momentary
    liquefaction of minute portions of the mass</i>, while the ice as
    a whole remains rigid, as its crystalline nature requires. Instead
    of assigning a slow viscous fluidity like that of asphalt to the
    <i>whole</i> mass, which seems inconsistent with its crystalline
    character, it assigns a free fluidity to a succession of particles that
    form only a minute fraction of the whole at any instant.</p>

  <p>This conception is consistent with the retention of the granular
    condition of the ice, with the heterogeneous (in the main) orientation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
    of the crystals, with the rigidity and brittleness of the ice, and with
    its strictly crystalline character, a character which a viscous liquid
    does not possess however much its high viscosity may make it resemble a
    rigid body.</p>

  <p><b>Accumulated motion in the terminal part of a glacier.—</b>However
    slight the relative motion of one granule on its neighbor, the granules
    in any part of a glacier partake in the accumulated motion of all parts
    nearer the source, and hence all are thrust forward. Herein appears
    to lie the distinctive nature of glacial movement. Each part of a
    stream of water feels the hydrostatic pressure of neighboring parts
    (theoretically equal in <i>all</i> directions) and the momentum of
    motion, but not the rigid thrust of the mass behind. Lava streams are
    good types of viscous fluids flowing in masses comparable to those of
    glaciers and on similar slopes, and, in their last stages, at similar
    rates, but their special modes of flow and their effects on the
    sides and bottoms of their paths are radically different from those
    of glaciers. Forceful abrasion, and particularly the rigid holding
    of imbedded stones while they score and groove the rock beneath, is
    unknown in lava streams and is scarcely conceivable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span> There is, so
    far as we know, no experimental or natural evidence that any typical
    viscous body in flowing over a rugose bottom detaches and picks up
    fragments and holds them as graving tools in its base so fixedly as
    to cut deep, long, straight grooves in the hard bottom over which it
    flows. It would seem that competency to do this peculiar class of work,
    which is distinctive of glaciers, should be demonstrated before the
    viscous theory of glacial movement is accepted as even a good working
    hypothesis. Somewhat in contrast with viscous movement, it is conceived
    that a glacier is thrust forward rigidly by internal elongation, shears
    forcibly over its sides and bottoms, and leaves its distinctive marks
    upon them.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 293.—Shearing plane well defined. A
    Spitsbergen glacier. (Hamberg.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4><i>Auxiliary Elements.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Shearing.—</b>In the lower portion of a glacier where normally the
    thrusts are greatest, the granules fewest, and their interlocking
    most intimate, shearing takes place within the ice itself. This is
    illustrated by the accompanying <a href="#fig292"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>, 292–295</a>. The shearing results
    in the foliation of the ice and in the forcing of débris between the
    sheared layers. Thus the ice becomes loaded in a special englacial or
    baso-englacial fashion, as previously mentioned and illustrated in <a href="#fig268"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 268</a>.</p>

  <p>Within the zone of shearing, it is probable that the gliding planes
    of the crystals come into effective function. It is thought that the
    combined effect of the vertical pressure, the forward thrust, and the
    basal drag of the ice, may be to increase the number of granules whose
    gliding planes are parallel to the glacier’s bottom. At any rate,
    Drygalski reports<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> that there is a tendency to such an arrangement
    in the basal portion of the Greenland glaciers at their borders. It
    is conceived that where strong thrusts are brought to bear upon such
    a mass of granules, those whose gliding planes are parallel to the
    direction of thrust are strained with sufficient intensity to cause the
    plates to slide over each other, while those which are not parallel
    to the direction of thrust are either rotated into parallelism—when
    they also yield—or are pressed aside out of the plane of shear. As
    previously noted, shearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span> is observed to occur chiefly where the ice
    below the plane of shearing is protected more or less from the force
    of the thrust. It perhaps also occurs where the basal ice becomes so
    overloaded with débris that it is incapable of ready movement.</p>

  <figure class="figleft illowp50" id="fig294">
    <img class="" src="images/fig294.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 294.—Portion of the lateral margin of a
    North Greenland glacier. Shows upturning of the layers at the base, the
    cleanness of the ice above the bottom, and, possibly, shearing.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It is also probable that sharp differential strain and shearing are
    developed at the level where the surface-water of the warm season,
    descending into the ice, reaches the zone of freezing. The expanding of
    the freezing water at the upper limit of the cold zone may cause the
    layer expanded by it to shear over that below. As the level of freezing
    is lowered with the advance of the warm season, the zone of shearing
    also sinks. This may be regarded as an auxiliary agency of shearing, of
    application to a special horizon.</p>

  <p><b>High temperature and water.—</b>In the zone of waste, a higher
    temperature and more water lend their aid to the fundamental
    agencies of movement, and there is need for these aids to promote a
    proportionate movement, for here the granules are more intimately
    interlocked and the ice more compact and inherently more solid and
    rigid. The average temperature is, however, near the melting-point (<a href="#Page_276"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
    276</a>), and during the warm season the ice is bathed in water so that
    the necessary changes in the crystals are facilitated, and movement
    apparently takes place even more readily than in the more open granular
    portion of lower temperature and dryer state. The extraordinary
    movements of certain tongues of ice in some of the great fiords of
    Greenland are probably due to the convergence of very thick slow-moving
    ice from the interior into basins leading down to the fiords. Into the
    same basins a large amount of surface-water is concentrated at the same
    time, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span> result that the thick ice, bathed with water and having
    a high gradient, develops unusual velocity during the warm season.</p>

    successive layers are not altogether the result of shear. They are due
    in part at least to differential melting along the lines where débris
    comes to the surface. The débris planes may be shear planes.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Applications.—</b>By a studious consideration of the coöperation of
    the auxiliary agencies with the fundamental ones, the peculiarities of
    glacial movement may apparently be explained. In regions of intense
    cold, where a dry state and low temperature prevail, as in the heart
    of Greenland, the snow-ice mass may accumulate to extraordinary
    thicknesses, for the burden of movement seems to be thrown almost
    wholly upon compression, with the slight aid of molecular changes due
    to internal evaporation and allied inefficient processes. Since the
    temperature in the upper part of the ice is very adverse (see <a href="#Page_277"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 277</a>),
    the compression must be great before it becomes effective in melting
    the ice, and hence the great thickness of the mass antecedent to much
    motion. Similar conditions more or less affect the heads of alpine
    glaciers, though here the high gradients favor motion with lesser
    thicknesses of ice; but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span> the lower reaches of alpine glaciers, where
    the temperatures are near the melting-point, and the ice is bathed in
    water, movement may take place in ice which is thin and compact.</p>

  <p>If the views here presented are correct, there is also, near the end
    or edge of a glacier, the coöperation of rigid thrust from behind with
    the tendency of the mass to move on its own account. The latter is
    controlled by gravity, and conforms in its results to laws of liquid
    flow. The former is a derived factor, and is a mechanical thrust. This
    thrust is different from the pressure of the upper part of a liquid
    stream on the lower part, because it is transmitted through a body
    whose rigidity is effective, while the latter is transmitted on the
    hydrostatic principle of equal pressure in all directions.</p>

  <h4><i>Corroborative Phenomena.</i></h4>

  <p>The conception of the glacier and its movement here presented explains
    some of the anomalies that otherwise seem paradoxical. While a glacier
    in a sense flows over a surface, it often cuts long, deep furrows in
    firm rock. It is difficult to explain this if the ice be so yielding
    as to flow under its own weight on a surface which is almost flat. If
    the mass is really viscous, its hold on its imbedded débris should
    also be viscous, and a bowlder in the bottom should be rotated in the
    yielding mass when its lower point catches on the rock beneath, instead
    of being firmly held while a deep groove is cut. This is more to the
    point since viscous fluids flow by a partially rotary movement. If,
    on the other hand, the ice is always a rigid body which yields only
    as its interlocking granules change their form by loss and gain, a
    rigid hold on the imbedded rock at some times, and a yielding hold at
    others, is intelligible, for on this view the nature of its hold is
    dependent on the temperature and dryness of the ice. Stones in the base
    of a glacier may be held with very great rigidity when the ice is dry,
    scoring the bottom with much force, while they may be rotated with
    relative ease when the ice is wet. In short, the relation of the ice to
    the bowlders in its bottom varies radically according to its dryness
    and temperature. <i>A dry glacier is a rigid glacier. A dry glacier is
    necessarily cold, and a cold glacier is necessarily dry.</i></p>

  <p>On the view here presented, a glacier should be more rigid in winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
    than in summer, and the whole thickness of the glacier should
    experience this rigidity chiefly at the ends and edges, where the
    relative thinness of the ice permits the low temperature to reach its
    bottom. The motion in these parts during the winter is, therefore, very
    small.</p>

  <p>In this view may also be found an explanation of the movement of
    glaciers for considerable distances on upward slopes, even when the
    <i>surface</i> as well as the base is inclined backwards. So far does
    this go that superglacial streams sometimes run for some distance
    <i>backwards</i>, i.e. toward the heads of the glaciers, while in
    other places surface-waters are collected into ponds and lakelets.
    Such a slope of the surface of ice is not difficult to understand if
    the movement be due to thrust from behind, or if it be occasioned by
    internal crystalline changes acting upon a rigid body; but it must be
    regarded as very remarkable if the movement be that of a fluid body,
    no matter how viscous, for the length of the acclivity is sometimes
    several times the thickness of the ice. Crevassing and other evidences
    of brittleness and rigidity find a ready elucidation under the view
    that the ice is a really solid body at all times, and that its apparent
    fluency is due to the momentary fluidity of small portions of the mass
    assumed in succession as compression demands.</p>

  <p>In addition to the considerations already adduced, it may be urged that
    a glacier does not flow as a stiff liquid because its granules are not
    habitually drawn out into elongated forms, as are cavities in lavas and
    plastic lumps in viscous bodies. Flowage lines comparable to those in
    lavas are unknown in glaciers.</p>

  <p>All this is strictly consistent with our primary thesis, that a glacier
    is a crystalline rock of the purest and simplest type, and that it
    never has other than the crystalline state. This strictly crystalline
    character is incompatible with viscous liquidity.</p>

  <h4><i>Other Views of Glacier Motion.</i><a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></h4>

  <p>While these views of glacial motion seem to us to best accord with the
    known facts, they are not to be regarded as established in scientific
    opinion, or as the views most commonly held. The mode of glacial
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>motion has long been a mooted question, and is still so regarded. The
    main alternative interpretations that have been entertained are the
    following:</p>

  <p>(1) In the early days of glacial studies De Saussure thought that
    glaciers slid bodily on their beds;</p>

  <p>(2) Charpentier and Agassiz referred the movement to the expansion of
    descending water freezing within the glacier;</p>

  <p>(3) Rendu and Forbes, followed by many, perhaps most, modern writers,
    believed ice to be viscous, and that in sufficiently large masses it
    flows under the influence of its own weight, like pitch or asphalt;</p>

  <p>(4) Others, realizing the fundamental difference between crystalline
    ice and a true viscous body, have fallen back on a vague notion of
    plasticity which scarcely amounts to a definite hypothesis at all;</p>

  <p>(5) Tyndall urged that the movement was accomplished by minute repeated
    fracturing and regelation, appealing to the fact that broken pieces of
    ice slightly pressed together at melting temperatures freeze together,
    but neglecting the fact that this would destroy the integrity of the
    crystals;</p>

  <p>(6) Moseley assigned the movement to a bodily expansion and
    contraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span> of the glacier, analogous to the creeping of a mass of
    lead on a roof;</p>

  <p>(7) James Thompson demonstrated that pressure lowers the melting-point,
    and while this effect is so small as probably to be ineffectual, it
    is correlated with the very important fact that compression may cause
    melting, which is not the case in most other rocks. He recognized that
    under pressure partial liquefaction took place, that the water so
    liberated might be refrozen as it escaped from pressure, and appears to
    have regarded this as a vital factor;</p>

  <p>(8) Croll held that the movement was due to a consecutive series of
    molecular changes somewhat like the chain of chemical combinations in
    electrolysis;</p>

  <p>(9) Hugi, Eli de Beaumont, Bertin, Forel, and others thought that the
    growth of the granules was the leading factor in the ice movement;</p>

  <p>(10) McConnel and Mügge have made the gliding planes of the ice
    crystals serve an important function in glacial movement.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the principle of partial liquefaction for which
    Thompson laid the basis, the crystallization of descending water, urged
    by Charpentier and Agassiz, and the granular growth on which Hugi,
    Beaumont, Forel, and others founded their hypotheses, are incorporated
    in the view already presented. Probably the agencies on which some of
    the other views are based may also be participants in producing glacial
    motion, sometimes as incidental factors, and sometimes perhaps as
    important ones, for under different conditions, different agencies may
    play rôles of varying importance. For example, in going over the brinks
    of precipices of sufficient height, glaciers break into fragments
    which are re-cemented below, and the “reconstructed” glacier moves on
    as before. Here fracture and regelation are evident. The movement of
    the gliding planes of the ice crystals over each other, which has been
    looked upon as a special kind of viscoid movement, probably plays a
    large part in the shearing movements in certain cases. But neither of
    these is probably a large factor in ordinary glacial movement, and it
    seems highly improbable that any of them are essential factors in the
    primary movements in the snow-fields where glacial action begins.</p>

  <p>Aside from the ingredients shown in the above tables, the presence of
    the following has been proved: iodine, fluorine, phosphorus, silicon,
    boron, silver, lead, copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel, iron, manganese,
    aluminum, barium, strontium, arsenic, lithium, cæsium, rubidium, and
    gold. Oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid gas are also present in
    quantity. The amount of carbonic acid is estimated to be 18 times as
    great as in the atmosphere.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

  <p>The amount of sea-water is estimated by Murray at 323,722,150 cubic
    miles,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> or about 15 times the volume of the land above sea-level.
    The volume and composition of the sea-water being known, the amount of
    mineral matter which it contains may be readily calculated. Assuming
    the average specific gravity of the mineral matter in solution to be
    2.5, the 3.5% by weight becomes 1.4% by volume, and 1.4% of 323,722,150
    cubic miles is 4,532,110 cubic miles. This then represents the
    aggregate volume of mineral matter in the sea if it were precipitated
    and compacted so as to have an average specific gravity of 2.5.
    Assuming the average depth of the sea to be 2076 fathoms (12,456 feet),
    as given by Murray, the mineral matter in solution, if precipitated,
    would cover the ocean bottom to a depth of about 175 feet. Assuming the
    area of the land to be to that of the sea as 28 to 72, this amount of
    mineral matter would make a layer about 450 feet deep over the land.
    Its amount is equal to about 20% of that of all lands above sea-level,
    and it falls but little short of that in all lands below 600 feet in
    altitude. If it were precipitated and concentrated in the shallow
    waters about the borders of the lands, it would fill the sea out to
    the depth of about 4000 feet, and would diminish its area by some
    19,000,000 to 20,000,000 square miles, an area which is more than ⅓
    of the present land surface. In other words, if the mineral matter in
    the sea-water were precipitated and concentrated in the shallow waters
    about the lands, it would restore the continental shelves to the land
    areas, and add an almost equal area beyond.</p>

  <p>These comparisons may perhaps help to give some idea of the amount of
    mineral matter in solution in the sea, but they give no more than a
    hint of the importance of the solvent power of water in the general
    processes of rock decay, for most of the substances carried to the sea
    in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>solution by rivers are extracted from the water about as rapidly
    as they are supplied. Thus calcium carbonate is about twenty times as
    abundant as sodium chloride in river-water,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> but is only ¹⁄₁₂₅ as
    abundant in sea-water.</p>

  <p>The total river discharge into the sea is estimated at 6524 cubic miles
    of water per year.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> This water is estimated to carry to the sea
    annually about half a cubic mile of mineral matter in solution. At this
    rate it would take about 9,000,000 years for the streams to bring to
    the sea an amount of mineral matter equal to that it now contains, but
    the proportions of the ingredients would be very different.</p>

  <p>The sodium chloride makes up about 2.4% of the mineral matter in
    river-water and nearly 78% of the mineral matter of the sea. At this
    rate it would take nearly 300,000,000 years for the salt of the sea
    to have been contributed by the rivers. It is not to be understood,
    however, that this figure indicates the age of the ocean. The salt is
    not all brought in by the rivers; the rivers have probably not always
    contributed at the present rate; and much salt once in the sea has been
    precipitated. Nevertheless the above figure gives some suggestion as to
    the order of magnitude of the figures which represent the age of the
    ocean.</p>

  <p>In contrast with the salt, the amount of calcium carbonate in the sea
    is so small that at their present rate of contribution, it would be
    brought to the sea by rivers in about 62,000 years.</p>

  <p><b>Topography of bed.—</b>The general relations of ocean basins to
    continents are suggested by <a href="#fig296"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 296</a>. The borders of the continental
    platforms are covered by the <i>epicontinental sea</i>, while the
    <i>abysmal sea</i> occupies the ocean basins proper. From the figure
    it is seen that an ocean basin is pronouncedly convex upward, and so
    departs as widely as may be from the current notion of the homely
    utensil from which it is named. Only when it is remembered that a
    level surface (on the earth) is one which has the mean curvature of
    the earth, and that the deeper parts of the ocean basin are well below
    the mean sphere level, does the current name seem justified.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The
    figure also shows that the depth of an ocean basin is slight compared
    with the radius of the earth.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span></p>

  <p>The bed of the ocean, like the face of the land, is affected by
    elevations and depressions, and its deepest points are about as far
    below its surface as the highest mountains are above it. There are
    areas of the sea bottom which, as a whole, may be compared to the
    plains of the land, and others which may be likened to plateaus, and
    the lines of gradation between them are as indistinct as they often
    are on the land. There are mountain peaks, chiefly of volcanic origin,
    and depressions comparable to the great basins on the land. But apart
    from these general features, there is little in common between the
    topography of the sea bottom and that of the land. Mountain systems
    are, for the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span> part, absent, though certain islands, like Cuba and
    some of its associates, may be regarded as the crests of systems which
    are chiefly submerged. If the water were drawn off from the ocean’s
    bed so that it could be seen as the land is, its most impressive
    feature would be its monotony. The familiar hills and valleys which,
    in all their multitudinous forms, give the land surface its most
    characteristic features are essentially absent. A large part of its
    surface would be found to be so nearly flat that the eye would not
    detect its departure from planeness.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig296">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/fig296.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 296.—General relations of ocean basins to

  </figure>

  <p>The reason for this profound difference is readily found. On the land,
    the dominant processes which shape the details of the surface are
    degradational, and though the final result of degradation is flatness
    (base-level), the immediate result is relief, and, most commonly,
    relief of the hill-and-valley type. In the sea, the dominant processes
    are aggradational, and tend to monotonous planeness.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution of marine life.—</b>Marine life has been of such
    importance in the history of the earth that the elementary facts
    concerning its distribution and the principles which control it are
    here recalled. The distribution of marine life is influenced by many
    factors, chief among which are <i>temperature</i> and <i>depth of
      water</i>. Not only is life more abundant in the warmer parts of the
    ocean than in the colder, but the species inhabiting cold waters are
    different from those in warm, and few species range through great
    variations. Many forms of life are restricted to shallow water. Many
    more, especially those which do not live on the bottom, swim about
    freely without reference to the depth of the water beneath them, while
    relatively few are restricted to great depths. Many species are also
    influenced by the <i>salinity of the water</i>, which varies notably
    along coasts where the fresh waters from the land are discharged;
    by the <i>character of the sediment</i> at the bottom, some species
    preferring mud, others sand, and others gravel; by the <i>movement of
    the waters</i>, some species preferring still waters and others rough;
    and some species by the <i>abundance and nature of the food-supply</i>,
    and by <i>rival and hostile species</i>.</p>

  <p>Subject to the exceptions determined by temperature, etc., plant life
    abounds in shallow water out to depths of 100 fathoms or so, and is
    found in abundance at the surface where the depth is much greater.
    Animal life abounds in shallow water, both at the bottom and above it,
    out to depths of 200 or 300 fathoms, and occurs in great profusion in
    the surface-waters of temperate and tropical regions without regard to
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span> depth. The great body of the ocean water lying below a depth of
    some few hundred fathoms is nearly tenantless, though life reappears
    sparingly at the bottom, even where the depth is great. For further
    discussion of this topic, see <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a>.</p>

  <h4>PROCESSES IN OPERATION IN THE SEA.</h4>

  <p>Within the area of the sea, as on the area of the land, three sets
    of processes are at work—<i>diastrophism</i>, <i>vulcanism</i>, and
    <i>gradation</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Diastrophism</b> (<a href="#Page_2"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 2</a>) affects the sea-bottom as the land, but
    the results are notably different in certain respects. So far as the
    lithosphere is concerned, the sea-level may be said to be the critical
    level. At and above it, many processes are in operation which do not
    appear below, and below it, many which do not take place above. Changes
    of level which do not involve the submergence of areas which were
    land, or the emergence of areas which were under water, are relatively
    unimportant, compared with those which effect such changes. The rise
    of the bottom of the sea from a depth of 500 fathoms to a depth of 200
    fathoms would not lead to important consequences, so far as the area
    itself is concerned, while an equal rise of the bottom beneath 200
    fathoms of water, or an equal subsidence of land 500 feet high, would
    be attended by more striking consequences. It follows that the changes
    effected by diastrophism are much more obvious along coasts than in the
    deep seas. Emergence or submergence shifts the zones of aggradation
    and degradation, shifts the zone of contact of ocean and land, and
    changes the region concerned from one appropriate for sea life to one
    appropriate for terrestrial forms, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

  <p>Over the continental shelves the water is shallow and the bottom
    relatively smooth. If a coastal region be elevated evenly, or if the
    sea-level be drawn down, the new shore-line on the smooth surface of
    the former submerged shelf will be relatively regular, even though the
    coast was notably irregular before the change. Thus in <a href="#fig297"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 297</a> the
    coast-line is notably irregular. A sea-withdrawal or a land-uplift of
    120 feet would change the coast-line to the position of the 20-fathom
    line, when it would be notably less irregular than now. If it were
    shifted to the 100-fathom line, few irregularities would remain. In so
    far as new coast-lines formed by the lowering of the sea (or rise of
    the crust) depart from straightness, it is usually by broad, smooth
    curves. Local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span> uplifts of coastal lands, and especially uplifts along
    axes normal to the trend of the coast, would give rise to projections
    of land, and so to coastal irregularities; but such uplifts are rarely
    so localized as to give origin to minor projections. It follows that
    rising coasts, and those which have recently risen, or more likely,
    coasts along which the sea-level is sinking or has recently sunk,
    are likely to be regular so far as details of outline are concerned.
    Subsidence of a coast-line (or rise of the sea-level) tends to the
    opposite results, for in this case the sea advances on a surface which
    has more or less relief, and the water takes possession of every
    depression brought to its level. The lower parts of the valleys are
    converted into bays, the length and width of which depend on the slope
    and width of the valleys drowned. The numerous bays at the debouchures
    of the streams along the Atlantic coast of the United States, from Long
    Island Sound to Carolina, such as the Delaware, Chesapeake, (<a href="#fig297"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 297</a>)
    and numerous smaller bays, are the results of recent sinking, which
    has allowed the sea to invade the lower ends of river valleys.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span> The
    ragged coast of Maine is another example, though glaciation as well as
    subsidence has been operative here. From the present configuration of
    coast-lines, it has been inferred that the present is, on the whole, an
    era of continental depression.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> River valleys, the lower ends of
    which are embayed, are sometimes found to be continuous with submerged
    valleys beyond the coast-line (<a href="#fig298"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 298</a>). Submerged river valleys show
    that the surface in which they lie was once land.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Bays may be developed by local subsidence as well as by the submerging
    of valleys, though decisive examples are not readily cited. Bays may
    also be produced by uplift of the surface on either side of an area
    which does not change its level. For example, uplift on either side of
    the Gulf of California has probably been one element, though probably
    not the only one, in the development of this indentation. The general
    outline of a great bay produced by coastal warping might be regular,
    though it would be likely to be marked by small irregularities where
    the streams enter. It is not to be understood that all, or even most,
    bays are due to local diastrophism.</p>

  <p>Diastrophism, then, as it affects the ocean-bottoms and the
    ocean-borders, may make the water of any ocean shallower or deeper; it
    may cause the emergence or submergence of land; it may make coast-lines
    regular or irregular; it may shift the habitat of life, and through
    these changes may greatly influence the processes of gradation, which
    are especially active along the contact of sea and land.</p>

  <p><b>Vulcanism</b> affects the sea-bottom much as it affects the
    land. At the volcanic centers, where the great body of extruded
    matter accumulates, mounds and mountains are built up. Most of the
    mountain peaks of the sea-bottom, whether their crests are islands,
    or whether they are wholly submerged, have had a volcanic origin. The
    rock material ejected from submarine vents is probably less widely
    distributed than that from vents on land, and so far forth, the
    volcanic cones in the oceans are steeper than those on land. Where
    volcanic cones are built up near the surface of the sea, they often
    furnish a home for shallow-water life, such as polyps. Wherever built
    up so as to be within the reach of waves, gradational processes are
    stimulated.</p>

  <p>The processes of vulcanism do not commonly influence coasts of
    continents directly, for few volcanoes lie immediately on coasts.
    In <span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>places, however, as at various points in and about Italy, the
    configuration of the coast is influenced by the building of volcanoes.
    Indirectly, vulcanism influences the shape of coast-lines, for the
    resistance of igneous rock is often different from that of the rock
    with which it is associated, and under the influences of the forces of
    gradation it may come to form projecting points or reëntrants, as the
    case may be.</p>

  <p>The number of active volcanoes on islands is about 200, or about
    two-thirds of all now known. Since the area of the sea is about three
    times that of the land, the known active volcanoes in the sea are
    rather less numerous per unit area than those on the land. The number
    of active vents beneath the sea is altogether unknown. A few submarine
    eruptions have been observed, and those observed are probably but a
    small percentage of those which have taken place in historic time.
    Slight eruptions in deep water might not manifest themselves at the
    surface in an unequivocal way, even were observers stationed near them.
    Volcanic cones which fail to reach the surface are known, and the forms
    of many sea-bottom mountain peaks are such as to make it probable that
    they are volcanic. These phenomena, as well as the numerous volcanic
    islands, give some indication of the importance of submarine eruptions
    in past time.</p>

  <p>Ocean volcanoes, and especially submarine volcanoes, affect both the
    temperature and the composition of the sea-water. Both the increase of
    temperature and the solution of volcanic gases increase the capacity of
    the water for mineral matter, and both the change in temperature and
    composition affect the life of the adjacent waters. The destruction
    of life during eruptions occasions the generation of the products of
    organic decomposition, and these stimulate further chemical changes.
    The diffusion of affected waters occasions chemical changes wherever
    they go. The effects of oceanic volcanoes on the sea-water are,
    therefore, appreciable, when long periods of time are considered. The
    deposition of the finer parts of volcanic discharges will be considered
    in connection with the deposits of the deep sea.</p>

  <p><b>Gradation.—</b>The gradational processes of the land and the sea
    are in striking contrast. On the land, degradation predominates, and
    aggradation is subordinate. In the sea, aggradation predominates, and
    degradation is subordinate. On the land, degradation is, on the whole,
    greatest where the land is highest, while aggradation is of consequence
    only where the land is low, or where steep slopes give place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span> to gentle
    ones. In the sea, degradation is virtually confined to shallow water,
    or to what might be called the highlands of the sea, while aggradation
    is nearly universal, but most considerable in shallow water, or
    where shallow water gives place to deep. Both the degradational and
    aggradational work of the sea are greatest near its shores. Opposed as
    the gradational work of the land and sea are, they yet tend to a common
    end—the leveling of the surface of the lithosphere.</p>

  <p>The gradational processes which affect the sea-bottom may be divided
    into three categories: (1) Those effected by mechanical means, (2)
    those effected by chemical means, and (3) those effected by organic
    agencies.</p>

  <p>The mechanical work of gradation in the sea is effected chiefly by the
    movements of the water, and, very subordinately, by the movements of
    the ice which the water carries. The results of these movements may be
    degradational wherever the water is sufficiently shallow for the motion
    to affect the bottom. Elsewhere it is aggradational.</p>

  <p>The direct gradational work effected by chemical means is likewise
    partly degradational and partly aggradational. If at any time or
    place the water becomes supersaturated with any mineral substance,
    precipitation takes place, and the precipitate accumulates as sediment
    on the bottom. This sometimes happens in lagoons and other small
    inclosures, and perhaps in open water. On the other hand, wherever
    solution is effected, degradation is the result. Solution is most
    important where the bottom consists of relatively soluble rock, such as
    lime carbonate.</p>

  <p>Organic agencies are, on the whole, aggradational. Accumulations of
    coral, coral débris, shells, etc., help to build up the sea-bottom,
    and most rapidly in shallow water where the proper forms of life are
    most abundant. Here also should be mentioned the accumulations of
    carbonaceous matter, especially in the form of plant bodies. In the
    aggradation effected directly by organic agencies, the sea is passive.
    Its only part is to support the life which gives rise to the solid
    matter, and incidentally to float a part of it in its currents.</p>

  <h3>MOVEMENTS OF THE SEA-WATER.</h3>

  <p>The movements of the sea-water fall into several categories. There is
    (1) a general circulation of sea-water, determined chiefly by three
    factors: differences in density in the sea-water, differences of level,
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span> the general movements of the atmosphere; (2) periodic movements
    which are not primarily circulatory, brought about by the attraction
    of the sun and moon; and (3) aperiodic movements, due to occasional
    causes, such as earthquakes, volcanic explosions, landslides, etc.,
    which determine local and temporary movements, often of exceptional
    strength.</p>

  <p><b>Differences in density and their results.—</b>Differences in density
    result from differences in temperature and salinity. Temperature alone
    considered, water would be densest where it is coldest, namely in
    the polar regions. Differences in salinity result from differences
    in evaporation and from inequalities in the supply of fresh water.
    Evaporation alone considered, the sea-water should be densest where
    evaporation is greatest; but the equatorial region, where evaporation
    is greatest, is also a region where precipitation is heavy, and
    precipitation, by freshening the water, opposes the effect of great
    evaporation. The greatest differences in density due to the unequal
    supply of fresh water are to be found near the borders of continents,
    where the precipitation on the land is discharged into the sea. In
    the polar regions, the great supply of fresh water, especially during
    the season when the ice is melting, opposes the effect of the low
    temperature, so far as the density of the water is concerned. The
    result of the operation of these factors affecting the density of the
    sea-water is to insure a general circulation, directed to the end
    of equalizing the densities; and since the disturbing factors are
    constantly in operation, equilibrium is never established, and the
    movements of the water are perpetual.</p>

  <p>The pressure gradients resulting from differences of density are so
    slight that the resulting movements are scarcely more than a creep of
    the waters. In general they are far too slow to be of importance in
    gradational work; but the earth’s rotation deflects the creeping waters
    and tends to concentrate the equator-ward movement into currents on
    the east sides of the continents, and the pole-ward movement on the
    west sides. In favorable situations these currents may be competent to
    produce sensible mechanical results. Even where this is not the case
    the circulation helps to equalize the temperatures of the sea, and so
    of the air above and of the land about. Indirectly, therefore, the
    circulation of the ocean-waters affects every geological process which
    is sensitive to climate.</p>

  <p><b>Differences in level and their results.—</b>While the surface of the
    ocean is the common datum plane to which elevations and depressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
    are referred, it is to be remembered that the sea has “a very
    complicated undulating surface in consequence of the attraction which
    the heterogeneous and elevated portions of the lithosphere exercise on
    the liquid hydrosphere. In the opinion of geodesists, the geoid may in
    some places depart from the figure of the spheroid by 1000 feet.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
    These variations in level would, however, not occasion circulation. The
    differences in level which determine circulation are much more trivial.
    Every stream which pours fresh water into the sea tends to raise the
    level of the water where it enters. The waters brought to the ocean by
    the Amazon, the Mississippi, and other great rivers would appreciably
    change the level of the sea at their debouchures, if the excess did
    not promptly flow away. The ready mobility of the water, however,
    prevents its accumulation, and the discharge of every stream generates
    widespread movement. This movement is strongest at the debouchure, and
    weakens with increasing distance from it, though in the case of great
    streams, such as the Amazon, the movement is traceable, by means of the
    sediment which the water carries, hundreds of miles out to sea.</p>

  <p>Changes of level are also brought about by the winds, which pile up
    water along the shore against which they blow. The level of the water
    is said to have risen 24 feet at Calcutta on October 5, 1864, as the
    result of a severe storm. While this is exceptional, a rise of 2
    feet is not rare. This piling up of the waters along shore insures a
    compensating movement (undertow, littoral currents, etc.) in some other
    direction. Unequal evaporation and precipitation likewise disturb the
    level of the sea and occasion movement. In the open sea the movements
    generated by differences of level, like those generated by differences
    of density, are chiefly slow, creeping movements, but movements which
    never cease. In bays and gulfs, on the other hand, the surface of the
    water may be so raised, either as the result of wind, river discharge,
    or heavy precipitation, as to give rise to strong outward currents.
    There is little doubt at the present time that the Gulf Stream owes its
    origin primarily to the difference of level between the Gulf of Mexico
    and the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

  <p><b>Movements generated by winds.—</b>The circulation resulting from the
    tendency of the winds to change the level of the sea-water has already
    been mentioned, but the wind also works in other ways. Where the winds
    have a somewhat constant direction and are at the same time <span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>strong,
    they determine a general movement of the surface-waters in their own
    direction, the surface-water being dragged along at a rate somewhat
    less than that of the wind itself. The constant trades appear to be
    the chief generators of the equatorial ocean-currents. Once generated,
    these currents may be concentrated and their courses modified. The
    currents generated by trades are turned north and south when directed
    against a continent; they are modified by the configuration of the
    bottom if the water be shallow, and always and everywhere, except, at
    the equator, they are deflected by the rotation of the earth, in the
    northern hemisphere to the right, and in the southern to the left. The
    pole-ward currents generated in the equatorial region by the trades,
    and directed by the winds, the lands, the configuration of the bottom,
    and the rotation of the earth, determine compensating currents from
    high latitudes to low, and the same influences which control the course
    of the former direct the latter as well.</p>

  <p>Since the atmospheric movements are so far constant that there is a
    prevailing direction of winds in all latitudes, the winds, as well
    as differences of density and differences of level, insure a general
    and continual circulation of sea-water. The geological effects of
    this circulation are direct and indirect; direct, by gradation of the
    bottom over which they flow, and indirect, by the modifications of
    climate they produce. Since rotation deflects the pole-ward currents
    to the east sides of the oceans (west sides of the continents) and the
    equator-ward movements to the west sides of the oceans (east sides of
    the continents), the east shores of the oceans are warmer than the west
    in corresponding latitudes, and the west sides of the continents are
    both warmer and moister<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> than the east sides.</p>

  <p>The most obvious disturbance of sea-water resulting from the winds
    is the generation of <i>waves</i>. Waves are not primarily parts of
    the general oceanic circulation. Since they are generated in other
    ways than by winds, and since the gradational effects of waves are
    independent of their origin, the effects of wind-waves will not be
    considered separately.</p>

  <p><b>Movements generated by attraction.—</b>One of the movements of
    the sea-water which is not primarily circulatory results from the
    attraction of the moon and sun. The tide is really the result of the
    <i>inequalities</i> of the attraction of these bodies on different
    parts of the earth. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>lunar tide is more important than the solar,
    not because the attraction of the moon is greater, for it is not, but
    because its differential attraction, the result of its lesser distance,
    is greater.</p>

  <p>The distance of the moon from the earth is about 240,000 miles. If
    this be taken as the distance from the center of the moon to the
    center of the earth, 236,000 and 244,000 miles respectively are the
    distances from the center of the moon to the nearest and most distant
    points on the earth. The distance of the sun from the earth is about
    93,000,000 miles. If this be taken as the distance between the centers
    of these bodies, then the distances from the center of the sun to the
    nearest and most distant points on the earth’s surface are 92,996,000
    and 93,004,000 miles respectively. The ratio of 4000 to 236,000 or to
    244,000 is much greater than the ratio of 4000 to 92,996,000 or to
    93,004,000. Hence the tide-producing force of the moon is greater than
    that of the sun.</p>

  <p>The tides show themselves along shores in the form of waves which, in
    shallow water, become translatory. They differ from the wind-waves in
    their periodicity, and locally in their greater height. The effects of
    the tidal waves on the shores of the sea, and on the bottom in shallow
    water, are the same as the effect of wind-waves of equal strength, and
    need not be separately considered in connection with the gradation of
    the sea-bottom. In passing through narrow straits or narrow passes of
    any sort, the tidal movement becomes a current which, under favorable
    conditions, abrades or “scours” the bottom effectively. The tidal
    currents in the narrow passes about New York harbor may serve as an
    illustration.</p>

  <p><b>Aperiodic movements.—</b>In addition to the wind-waves which are
    essentially constant and universal, and to the tidal waves, which are
    periodic, there are accidental waves which are locally and temporarily
    of importance. Such are earthquake-waves, which are sometimes extremely
    destructive. Thus an earthquake-wave on the coast of Peru in 1746 swept
    a frigate several miles inland and deluged Lima, seven miles from the
    shore. The havoc of most earthquakes affecting coasts, such as that
    of Lisbon in 1755, is greatly aggravated by accompanying sea-waves.
    Earthquake-waves differ from ordinary waves in being translatory, and
    so in being more effective on the bottom in deep water. Their greatest
    force, however, is felt in shallow water and on shores. Volcanic
    eruptions likewise give rise to exceptional aperiodic waves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span> The same
    is true of landslides where they affect the coast or any part of the
    sea-bottom. The fall of glacier ends and the capsizing of icebergs
    likewise generate strong waves. To the category of exceptional waves
    also belong those generated by the winds of exceptional storms, such as
    that which devastated Galveston in 1900.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

  <p><b>Summary.—</b>From the point of view of their direct geological
    results in shallow water, all movements of the sea-water may be grouped
    into two main classes—(1) waves, with the undertow and the littoral
    currents they generate, and (2) ocean-currents.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

  <h3>WAVES.</h3>

  <p><b>Wave-motion.</b><a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>—The most common waves, and from the present
    point of view the most important, are those generated by winds. During
    the passage of a wave, each particle affected by it rises and falls,
    and moves forward and backward describing an orbit in a vertical plane.
    If the passing wave is a swell, the orbit of the particle is closed
    and is either a circle or an ellipse; but in the case of a wind-wave
    the orbit is not closed. In such a wave two things move forward, the
    undulation and the water. The velocity of the undulation is relatively
    rapid; that of the water, slow and rhythmic. On the crest of the
    wind-wave each particle of water moves forward, and in the trough it
    moves less rapidly backward, and the excess of the forward movement
    over the backward gives it a slight residual advance. This residual
    advance is the initiatory element of current. By virtue of it, the
    upper layer of water is carried forward with reference to the layer
    below, in the direction toward which the wind blows. The waves of any
    considerable or long-continued wind, therefore, generate a current
    tending in the same direction as the wind.</p>

  <p>The agitation of which waves are the superficial manifestation
    is not restricted to the surface, but is propagated indefinitely
    downward. Near the surface the amount of motion diminishes rapidly
    with increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span> depth (<a href="#fig299"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 299</a>), but the rate of diminution itself
    diminishes, and there seems no theoretic reason for assigning any
    definite limit to the downward propagation of the oscillation.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig299">
    <img class="illowp66" src="images/fig299.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 299.—Figure illustrating the decrease in
    the amount of wave-movement with increase of depth. (Fenneman.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>At the surface, the radius of the circular orbit which a particle of
    water in a wave tends to describe is half the height of the wave. At a
    depth equal to one wave-length, the radius of the circle described by
    a particle is ¹⁄₅₃₅ as great as at the surface, and at a depth equal
    to two wave-lengths, ¹⁄₃₀₀₀₀₀. If the height of a wave be 43 feet, the
    radius of the circle described by a surface particle is 21½ feet. If
    the length of the wave be 300 feet, the radius of a particle at a depth
    of 300 feet is only about ⁴⁄₁₀ of an inch, and at 600 feet ¹⁄₁₂₀₀ of an
    inch.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> These figures make it clear that effective agitation of the
    water does not extend to great depths.</p>

  <p>So long as the velocity of the wind remains constant, the velocity
    of the current which the wind-waves generate is less than that of
    the wind, and there is always a differential movement of the water,
    each layer moving faster than the one beneath. The friction is thus
    distributed through the whole vertical column of the water in movement,
    and is even borne in part by the sea-bottom if the movement extends
    so far down. The greater the depth, the smaller the share of the
    friction each layer of water is called upon to bear, and the greater
    the velocity of the current generated by a given wind. But while the
    wave-motion extends indefinitely downward, the lower limit of agitation
    effective in erosion is soon reached. Engineering operations have shown
    that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>submarine structures are little disturbed at depths of five
    meters in the Mediterranean and eight meters in the Atlantic.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> On
    the other hand, débris as coarse as gravel, which is transported by
    rolling on the bottom, is not infrequently carried out to depths of
    50 feet, and sometimes even to 150 feet. Fine sediment, like silt, is
    disturbed at still greater depths, for ripple-marks, which indicate
    agitation of the water, are said to have been found at depths of 100
    fathoms.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

  <p>When a wave approaches a shelving shore, its habit is changed. The
    velocity of the undulation is diminished, while the velocity of the
    advancing particle of water in the crest is increased; the wave-length,
    measured from trough to trough, is diminished, and the wave-height is
    increased; the crest becomes acute, with the front steeper than the
    back, and these changes culminate in the breaking of the crest, when
    the undulation proper ceases. Waves of a given height break in about
    the same depth of water, and the line along which incoming waves break
    is the line of <i>breakers</i>. The line of breakers is in deeper
    water and farther from shore when the waves are strong than when
    they are weak. Waves are reported to have broken in 100 fathoms of
    water,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> but this must be regarded as very exceptional. The return
    of the water thrown forward in the crests of waves is accomplished by
    a current along the bottom called the <i>undertow</i>. The undertow is
    sensibly normal to the coast when uninfluenced by oblique waves, and is
    efficient in removing the products of erosion.</p>

  <p>Since the incoming wave affects water which is at the same time under
    the influence of the undertow, it gives to that current a pulsating
    character, for the wave-motion sometimes supports and sometimes
    opposes the undertow, and thus endows it with a higher transporting
    power than belongs to its mean velocity. Near the breaker-line, the
    oscillations communicated by the wave may momentarily overcome and
    even reverse the movement of the undertow. Inside the breaker-line,
    irregular oscillation only is communicated. The broken wave-crest,
    dashing forward, overcomes the undertow and throws it back, and the
    water returns as a simple current descending a slope. The power <span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>of the
    undertow diminishes rapidly from the breaker-line outward as the depth
    of the water increases.</p>

  <p>When waves advance on the shore obliquely, a shore-current is developed
    as illustrated by <a href="#fig300"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 300</a>, where <i>ab</i> represents the direction of
    the incoming wave, <i>bc</i> the direction of the littoral current, and
    <i>bd</i> the direction of the undertow. Where they strike the borders
    of land, the wind-waves, therefore, generate two other movements,
    the undertow and the littoral current. Any particle of water near
    shore may be affected by any two or by all three of these movements
    at the same moment. The effect of littoral current and undertow is
    to give a particle of water on which both are working a direction
    between the two, as <i>be</i>. The effect of other combinations can be
    readily inferred. These various combinations are of consequence in the
    transportation of débris.</p>

  <h3>WORK OF THE WAVES.</h3>

  <h4><i>Erosion.</i></h4>

  <p>The general effects of the waves and the other movements to which
    they give rise along shores are (1) the wear of the shores; (2) the
    transportation for greater or less distances of the products of wear;
    and (3) the deposition of the transported materials.</p>

  <p><b>By waves and undertow.—</b>In the dash of the waves against the
    shore, the chief wear is effected by the impact of the water and of
    the débris which the water carries. Lesser results are accomplished in
    other ways.</p>

  <p>When the land at the margin of the water consists of unconsolidated
    material, or of fragmental material but slightly cemented, the impact
    of the water is sufficient to displace or erode it. If weak rock be
    associated with resistant rock within the zone of wave-work, the
    removal of the former may lead to the disruption and fall of the
    latter, especially when weak rock is washed out from beneath the
    strong. The impact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> of the water is competent also to break up and
    remove rock which was once resistant, but which has been superficially
    weakened by changes of temperature. Rock affected by numerous open
    joints is likewise attacked with success, for by the dash of the waves
    the blocks between the joints may be loosened and literally quarried
    out. It may, however, be doubted whether the dash of waves of clear
    water, even when their force is many tons to the square foot, has any
    appreciable power to wear rock which is thoroughly solid.</p>

    Grand Island, Lake Champlain. The rock is Black River limestone.
    Although from the shore of a lake instead of the sea, the principles
    illustrated are the same. (Perry.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The impact of the waves is generally reinforced and made effective
    by the impact of the detritus they carry. The sand, the pebbles, and
    such stones as the waves can move are used as weapons of attack, being
    turned against one another and against the shore. Masses of rock too
    large for the waves to move (<a href="#fig301"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 301</a>) are worn by the detritus</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

  <p>driven back and forth over them, and in time reduced to movable
    dimensions (<a href="#fig302"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 302</a>). They then become the tools of the waves, and in
    use, are reduced to smaller and smaller size. Thus bowlders are reduced
    to cobbles, cobbles to pebbles, pebbles to sand, and sand to silt.
    The silt is readily held in suspension in agitated water, and thus is
    carried out beyond the range of breakers, and settles in water so deep
    as not to be effectively agitated to its bottom. Thus one generation
    of bowlders after another is worn out, and the comminuted products are
    carried out from the immediate shore and deposited in deeper water.</p>

  <p>The effectiveness of waves, whether they work by impact of water alone,
    or by impact of water and detritus, is dependent on their strength
    and on the concentration of their blows.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The strength of waves
    is dependent on the strength of the winds (or other generating cause)
    and the depth and expanse of the water, and the concentration of
    their blows is conditioned by the slope against which they break. On
    exposed ocean-coasts the fetch of the waves is always great. The winds
    are variable. For a given coast they have an average strength, but
    the effectiveness of wave-erosion is determined less by the average
    strength of waves than by the strength of the storm-waves. This is
    often very great. On the Atlantic and North Sea coasts of Britain,
    winter breakers which exert a pressure of three tons per square
    foot are not infrequent.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> So great is the force of exceptional
    storm-waves that blocks of rock exceeding 100 tons in weight are
    known to have been moved by them. Ground-swells, “even when no wind
    is blowing, often cover the cliffs of north Scotland with sheets of
    water and foam up to heights of 100 or even nearly 200 feet. During
    northeasterly gales the windows of the Dunnet Head lighthouse, at
    a height of upwards of 300 feet above high-water mark, are said
    to be sometimes broken by stones swept up the cliffs by sheets of
    sea-water.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The average force of waves on the Atlantic coast of
    Britain has been found to be 611 lbs. per square foot in summer, and
    2086 lbs. in winter.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

  <p>Where deep water extends up to the shore, the force of the wave is
    almost wholly expended near the water line; where shallow water borders
    the land, the force of the waves is expended over a greater area.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>Waves are, therefore, most efficient on bold coasts bordered by broad
    expanses of deep water.</p>

  <p>The less familiar phases of wave-work are accomplished by hydraulic
    pressure, compressed air, the use of ice, etc. When the water of a
    wave is driven into an open joint or a cave, the hydraulic pressure
    is great, and if the structure be weak, the rock may be broken. When
    water is driven with force into a cave, the compression of the air
    may be great if the wave be high enough to close the entrance. When
    the water runs out of a cave, the air within may be greatly rarefied,
    while that above exerts its normal pressure. In either case the roof
    of the cave, if it be weak, may be broken. At certain seasons of the
    year, especially during the spring, waves make destructive use of the
    ice which is then breaking up, but it is only in high latitudes that
    sea-ice is of consequence in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span> way. In general, the effect of its
    presence in keeping down waves overbalances its effect as an agent of
    erosion.</p>

    The rock is Utica shale. (Perry.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The direct effect of wave-erosion is restricted to a zone which is
    narrow both horizontally and vertically. There is no impact of breakers
    at levels lower than the troughs of the waves, though erosion may
    extend down to the limit of effective agitation (<a href="#Page_341"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 341</a>). The efficient
    impact of waves is limited upward by the level of the wave-crests,
    although the dash of the water produces feebler blows at higher levels.
    The rise and fall of the water during the flow and ebb of the tides
    gives the waves a greater vertical range than wind-waves alone would
    have. The vertical zone of direct wave-work is therefore limited above
    by the level of wave-crests, and below by the depth of wave-troughs
    (nearly). The indirect work of waves is limited only by the height
    of the shore, for as the zone of excavation is carried landward,
    masses higher up the slope are undermined and fall. The fallen rock
    temporarily protects the shore against the waves, but are themselves
    eventually broken up.</p>

  <p>The pulsating current of the undertow (<a href="#Page_341"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 341</a>) has both an erosive and
    a transporting function. It carries the detritus of the shore to and
    fro, and dragging it over the bottom, continues downward the erosion
    initiated by the breakers. This downward erosion is the necessary
    concomitant of the shoreward progress of wave-erosion; for, if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
    land were merely planed away to the level of the wave-troughs, the
    incoming waves would break where shoal water was first reached, and
    become ineffective at the water margin. The rate of erosion by the
    undertow becomes less and less as the surface it affects is lowered.
    Littoral currents do little erosive work beyond that inflicted on the
    material which they transport.</p>

  <p>The general result of wave-erosion is the advance of the sea on the
    land, the rate of advance being determined chiefly by the nature of the
    material attacked and the strength of the waves. Numerous as examples
    are of the retreat of coast-lines before the advance of the sea, it
    is not to be understood that the advance of the sea on the land is
    universal or uninterrupted. Numerous instances may be cited of the
    encroachment of the land on the sea. At Long Branch the advance of the
    sea, in spite of elaborate breakwaters, has been so rapid in recent
    years as to menace important buildings, while a few miles to the north
    and south,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span> the land is advancing in the face of the waves. The low
    coast of the Middle Netherlands has retreated two miles or more in
    historic times,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> but the opposite tendency is shown at other points
    in the same region. On the coast of England the sites of villages have
    disappeared by the advance of the sea within historic times,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> but
    the coast of the same island affords illustrations of land advance. On
    the south side of Nantucket island, the sea-cliff has been known to
    retreat before the waves as much as six feet in a single year.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
    Almost every considerable stretch of coast affords illustrations both
    of the advance of the sea on the land and of land on the sea; but in
    the long run, the former must exceed the latter, diastrophic movements
    aside.</p>

  <p><b>The sea-cliff.—</b>The action of the waves, cutting as they do
    along a definite horizontal zone, has been compared to the action of
    a horizontal saw. As the waves cut into the shore at and near the
    water-level, the material above, being unsupported, falls, leaving
    a steep face above the line of cutting. This steep face is known as
    <i>the sea-cliff</i> (<a href="#fig301"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 301 to 306</a>). The same term is sometimes
    applied to the cliffs of lakes. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>The principles involved in the
    development of the sea-cliff are applicable to any broad stretch of
    water.</p>

  <p>The height of the cliff depends on the height of the land on which
    the sea is advancing. Its slope may be steep or gentle (compare <a href="#fig303"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>
    303 to 306</a>), according to the nature of the material of which it is
    composed and the rapidity of the cutting. Rapid cutting tends to
    produce steep cliffs and slow cutting gentle ones, for in the latter
    case weathering is more important relative to the cutting, and at
    sea-level (low altitudes) weathering generally tends to reduce the
    angle of slope. In general, the more resistant the material the steeper
    the slope of the cliff. Incoherent materials, such as sand and clay,
    are not likely to form steep cliffs; but if the cutting be very rapid,
    bold faces may be developed even in such materials (<a href="#fig307"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 307</a>). If beds
    of slight resistance at sea-level underlie beds of greater resistance,
    the development of steep cliffs is favored. The structure of the
    cliff-rock also has an influence on the slope. The rock may be massive
    or bedded. If bedded, the beds may be horizontal, or they may dip at
    any angle, in any direction. The rock, whether stratified or not, may
    be abundantly or sparsely jointed. All these structures influence the
    slope and configuration of the sea-cliff (see <a href="#fig305"><abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 305 to 308</a>).</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 309.—“Old Man of Hoy.” (Geikie.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Chimney-rocks, etc.—</b>By working in along the joints of the rock,
    widening them and quarrying out the intervening blocks, pillars of
    rock (“chimney-rocks,” “pulpit-rocks”) or even considerable islets are
    sometimes isolated by the waves. This is most readily accomplished
    where the joints converge back from the shore. A well-known example
    of this sort is the “Old Man of Hoy” (<a href="#fig309"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 309</a>) on the coast of the
    Orkneys. A pulpit-rock or other island, or any jutting point of
    rock may be pierced, giving an arch or bridge. La Roche Percée, a
    steep-faced isle near Gaspé Harbor, is an example.</p>

  <p><b>Sea-caves.—</b>Waves sometimes excavate caves at the bases of
    cliffs. This is especially likely to occur where the rock is much
    jointed and where the joints are not continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span> to the surface in
    a single plane. The bottom and roof of a sea-cave usually have a
    pronounced inclination landward. If the cliff be low, the cave may be
    extended landward until its roof is pierced. Through such an opening in
    the top of the cliff the water of the incoming waves may be forced in
    the form of spray. On the New England coast such holes are sometimes
    known as “spouting horns.” Similar openings may be made, as already
    pointed out, by the compression or rarefaction of the air in the cave
    as the wave enters or retreats. If the roof of the cave be partially
    destroyed, the portion which remains may form an arch or <i>bridge</i>.
    Such a bridge occurs on Santa Cruz Island, California (<a href="#fig310"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 310</a>).</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig310">

  </figure>

  <p>The cave, the “spouting horn,” the “bridge,” the “pulpit-rock,” and
    other isolated islets, are all closely associated with the sea-cliff in
    origin.</p>

  <p><b>The wave-cut terrace.—</b>The bottom of the sea-cliff is bordered by
    a submerged platform over which the water is shallow. This platform, or
    at any rate its landward portion, represents the area over which the
    water has advanced as the result of wave-cutting, and is, therefore,
    known as the <i>wave-cut terrace</i>. From the method of cliff
    development it will be seen that the wave-cut terrace is its necessary
    accompaniment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span> Such a terrace has a gentle slope to seaward, for its
    outer and older edge has been degraded longer and more. Its slope is
    influenced by the strength of the waves, being greater where they are
    stronger. The outer edge of the wave-cut terrace is often marked by
    an abrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span> descent. <a href="#fig303"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 303</a> represents the wave-cut terrace in its
    relation to the sea-cliff above.</p>

    Lake. In this case the water-level has been lowered. (Gilbert,
    <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>So long as wave-cut terraces are submerged, they do not appear on
    topographic maps of the land, though they appear on the charts of the
    coasts; but if a coastal tract with wave-cut terraces be elevated, or
    if the sea-level be drawn down, the terraces become land. Elevated
    sea-cliffs and wave-cut terraces are among the best evidences of change
    of relative level between water and land (<a href="#fig311"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 311</a>).</p>

  <p><b>Wave-erosion and horizontal configuration.—</b>The structure of the
    rock along shore has as much to do with the horizontal configuration of
    the wave-shaped coast, as with its relief. In general, waves develop
    reëntrants in the less resistant portions of the shore, leaving the
    more resistant parts as headlands (San Pedro Point and Devil’s Slide,
    <a href="#plate_XX"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XX</a>, Coast of California). It is to be noted that the resistance
    of rock to wave-erosion is not determined by its hardness alone.
    Every division plane, whether due to bedding, to jointing, or to
    irregular fracture, is a source of weakness to the rock, and rock
    of great hardness may be so broken as to offer relatively little
    resistance. Inequalities of resistance, whatever their cause, give
    origin to inequalities of coastal configuration where wave-erosion is
    in progress. Given a coast of marked regularity and equal exposure,
    but composed of unequally resistant material, the waves will make it
    irregular by cutting most where the material is least resistant. A
    regular coast of uniform material, but unequal exposure, will be made
    irregular by the greater cutting at the points of greater exposure. A
    coast of marked irregularity and homogeneous material will be made more
    regular by the cutting off of the projecting points, because they are
    most exposed. With a given set of conditions, waves tend to develop
    a certain sort of shore-line which, so far as its horizontal form is
    concerned, is relatively stable. Such a shore-line may be said to be
    <i>mature</i><a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> so far as wave-erosion is concerned. Since coastal
    lands are, in general, both heterogeneous and unequally exposed, a
    mature coast-line is somewhat irregular. Its maturity is attained when
    the lesser exposure in the reëntrants developed in the less resistant
    parts, balances the superior exposure of the projections of the more
    resistant portions.</p>

  <p>Since the conditions of erosion along coasts are constantly, even if
    slowly, changing, maturity is constantly being approached, but rarely
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>reached. Other forces and processes, such as those of aggradation,
    vulcanism, and diastrophism, are in operation along coasts, and
    their results are sometimes antagonistic to those of the waves. The
    horizontal configuration of coasts is, therefore, the result of many
    coöperating forces, of which waves are but one. It is, nevertheless,
    important to note the goal to which the waves are working, even though
    they are continually defeated in their attempt to reach it. Their
    immediate goal is an equilibrium of erosion-rate and maturity of
    configuration; their final goal is the destruction of the land and the
    deposition of its substance in the sea, that is, in a position nearer
    the center of gravity of the earth.</p>

  <h4><i>Transportation by Waves.</i></h4>

  <p>The material eroded from the shore by the waves in the shaping of the
    cliff and terrace is carried away by the joint action of the waves,
    undertow, and shore-currents.</p>

  <p>The in-coming wave begins to shift material where it begins to drag
    bottom, that is, a little outside the line of breakers. From the line
    where transportation begins, to the line of breakers, bottom detritus
    is shifted shoreward by the waves, while the undertow tends to carry it
    back again. Between the breakers and the shore there is also a tendency
    for the on-shore movement to carry débris to the water’s edge, and for
    the ebbing wave to carry it back again. The result of these opposed
    tendencies is to keep sediment in transit between the shore and the
    line of breakers. If the in-coming waves have a direction normal to the
    shore, the advance and recoil of the water move particles toward and
    from the shore, but effect no transfer along the shore; but the results
    which waves normal to the shore would achieve are always modified by
    other waves and by littoral currents.</p>

  <p>If the in-coming wave is oblique to the shore, it shifts material in
    its own direction. The transfer by undertow, taken alone, would be
    sensibly normal to the shore, but the effect of the oblique waves is
    to slightly modify this direction. There is thus a slow transportation
    along shore, even in the absence of steady currents. A great amount
    of transportation would be effected in this way, though it would
    be carried on at a slow rate. Oblique waves also tend to develop a
    definite shore-current (<a href="#Page_342"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 342</a>) which affects both the amount and
    direction of the transportation. Any particle in suspension, or in
    motion on the bottom as the result of the wave or undertow, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span> shifted
    along shore by the littoral current, which affects the same water
    (<a href="#fig300"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 300</a>). By the coöperation of wave- and shore-current, more and
    heavier material can be moved than by either alone, and the direction
    of movement is more nearly parallel to the shore than that of the
    wave. Similarly, by the coöperation of undertow and shore-current,
    more and heavier material can be moved than by either alone. The
    direction of movement is readily inferred from <a href="#fig300"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 300</a>. The direction
    in which débris is shifted by wave- and shore-current is modified by
    the undertow, and the direction which would result from undertow and
    current is modified by the wave. It is often the waves of storms,
    rather than those of the prevailing winds, which determine the
    direction of greatest shore transportation.</p>

  <p>The waves, the undertow, and the littoral currents work together in
    assorting the detritus of the shore. The coarsest parts may be beyond
    the power of all but the strongest waves. They accumulate where
    agitation is great. Less coarse parts are shifted farther from the site
    of greatest agitation, but no materials which are classed as coarse
    are carried beyond the depth of sensible movement. The coarse material
    which covers the bottom where the agitation of the water at the bottom
    is effective, constitutes <i>shore drift</i>.</p>

  <p>Shore drift is not all derived from the shore by the cutting of the
    waves. A part of it is brought to the sea by streams and mingled with
    that eroded from the cliffs. The material which is fine enough to be
    held in suspension is measurably independent of depth. This is shown
    during storms when the water becomes turbid far beyond the line of
    breakers, and clears only after the waves have died away.</p>

  <p>This sorting of shore drift, effected while it is in transportation, is
    often very perfect. The conditions favoring assortment are (1) vigorous
    wave-action, (2) prolonged transportation, and (3) a moderate volume of
    sediment.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The effect of these several conditions will be readily
    understood.</p>

  <p>Extensive transportation of shore drift of a given degree of coarseness
    is favored by (1) strong waves and undertow, (2) continuous currents,
    and (3) shallow water, deepening but gradually off shore.</p>

  <p><b>The beach.—</b>The zone occupied by the shore drift in transit is
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span><i>beach</i>. The lower margin is beneath the water, a little

    is at the level reached by storm-waves, and is usually a few feet
    above the level of still water. To the beach, material is brought from
    seaward by the in-coming waves, and from it detritus is carried out
    by the undertow. The cross-section of a beach is shown in <a href="#fig312"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 312</a>.
    In horizontal position the beach follows the general boundary between

  </figure>

  <p><b>The barrier.—</b>When the agitation of the water along shore becomes
    insufficient to carry the material, it is dropped. In its deposition it
    assumes various forms. Where the bottom of the lake or sea near shore
    has a very gentle inclination, the in-coming waves break some distance
    from the shore-line, and it is here that the most violent agitation
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>occurs when the waves are strong. To this line of breakers, material
    is shifted from both directions: from shore by undertow, and from
    seaward by the waves. Accumulating here, it builds up a low ridge. This
    is a <i>barrier</i> (<a href="#fig314"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 314</a>). If it is built up above the surface of
    the water by storm-waves, it may shut in a lagoon behind it, and this
    may ultimately be filled by sediment washed down from the land. At one
    stage in the filling, the lagoon becomes a marsh.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> In the part

  </figure>

  <p><b>The spit, the bar, and the loop.—</b>The disposition of
    shore-deposits depends largely on the currents at and near shore. If
    the coast-line is deeply indented, the littoral current usually fails
    to follow the reëntrants. In holding its course across the mouth of
    a small bay, a shore-current usually passes into deeper water. Here
    its velocity is checked because its motion is communicated to the
    water beneath it, and a larger amount of water being involved in the
    motion, the motion of each part is diminished. If sediment was being
    moved along its bottom before the current was checked, some part of
    it is dropped when and where the current is slackened. It follows
    that deposition commonly takes place beneath a littoral current as it
    crosses the mouth of a bay. The belt of deposition is often narrow,
    and the result is the construction of a ridge beneath the water in
    the direction of the current. The current would never build the
    embankment up to the water-level, but when <span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>its surface approaches the
    level of effective agitation, the waves may begin to work on it, as
    on a barrier, and may build it up to, and even above, the surface of
    the water. So long as the end of such an embankment is free, it is a
    <i>spit</i> (<a href="#fig315"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 315</a> and <a href="#plate_XXI"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXI</a>). If the spit be lengthened until
    it crosses, or nearly crosses, the bay, shutting it off from the open
    water, it becomes a bar. Bars have shut in lakes (ponds) on the coast
    of Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. (<a href="#plate_XXIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXII</a>), and lakes and lagoons
    at numerous points both on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts (<a href="#plate_XXIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2,
    <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXII</a>, Rodeo lagoon). The same phenomena are to be seen along many
    lake shores. Bars sometimes tie islands to the mainland (<a href="#plate_XXIIIa"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXIII,
    <abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 1</a>, Nahant, Mass.; <a href="#plate_XXIIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2</a>, near Biddeford, Me.). The structure of a
    bar as seen in cross-section is shown in <a href="#fig316"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 316</a>.</p>

  <p>The construction of a spit has been aptly compared to the construction
    of a railway embankment across a depression. The material is first
    carried out from the bordering upland (shallow water) and dumped where
    the slope to the depression (deep water) begins. The embankment thus
    begun is extended by the carrying out of new material, which is left at
    the end of the dump already made.</p>

  <p>If the bay across which the bar is built receives abundant drainage
    from the land, the outflow from the bay may be sufficient to prevent
    the completion of the bar (<a href="#plate_XXIIa"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXII</a>), for when the growth of
    the spit has sufficiently narrowed the outlet of the bay, the sediment
    brought to the end of the spit by the littoral current will be swept
    out beyond the spit by the current setting out from the bay.</p>

  <p>The completion of a bar may be interfered with by tidal currents, even
    without land-drainage. Currents generated by the tides may sweep in
    or out of the bay with increased force as the entrance is narrowed,
    carrying in or out the sediment which the littoral current would have
    left at the end of the spit. The scour of the tides often insures
    deep entrances (inlets) to bays, and maintains definite channels or
    “thorofares” in the lagoon marshes behind barriers and spits. The
    sediment brought down from the land, as well as that washed in by tidal
    currents and waves, tends to fill up the lagoon behind a barrier, a
    spit, or a bar, converting it into land (<a href="#fig317"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 317</a>).</p>

  <p>Since spits and bars are built only where there is shore-drift in
    transit, they are always built out from a beach or barrier. The distal
    end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span> bar may also join a beach or barrier. Traced back to
    its source, the beach from which a spit leads out is often found to
    terminate in the cliff from which the material of the beach and the
    spit were derived (<a href="#plate_XX"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XX</a> and <a href="#plate_XXIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXII</a>). In such cases the
    sediment of the beach has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> been shifted but a short distance; but in
    other cases it has traveled far.</p>

    and G. Surv.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The spit is usually either straight or in conformity with the general
    course of the shore-current, but since the littoral current itself is
    subject to alteration as the result of shifting winds, the spit may
    depart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span> from straightness. Winds which simply reverse the direction of
    the littoral current retard its construction, but may not otherwise
    affect it; but if a strong current be made to flow past the end of a
    spit, it may cut away its extremity and rebuild the materials into a
    smaller spit, joining the main one at an angle. This gives rise to a
    <i>hook</i> (<a href="#fig315"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 315</a>). Successive storms may develop successive hooks
    along the side of a growing spit. The end of a hook may be so extended
    as to join the mainland, when it becomes a <i>loop</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Wave-built terraces.—</b>Under the influence of off-shore currents,
    littoral currents may be drawn from the coast-line. If such a current
    continues as a well-defined surface-current, it builds a spit, but
    if it spreads, it tends to build a terrace. The accumulation then
    is not at the end of a beach, as in the case of a spit, but on its
    side, and the result of the deposition is to carry the beach seaward.
    The undertow abets the process. The widened beach is a <i>wave-built
    terrace</i>. The wave-built terrace often borders the wave-cut terrace
    along its seaward margin (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig303">303</a> and <a href="#fig318">318</a>). With the help of waves,
    the surface of the terrace may be built up into land by the expansion
    of the crest of the beach. Terrace-cutting and terrace-building are
    both involved in the development of the continental shelves.</p>

  <p>Beach ridges, spits, bars, etc., like sea-cliffs and wave-cut terraces,
    are often preserved after the relative level of sea and land has
    changed. If the shore has risen, relatively or absolutely, these
    features are relied on as evidences of the change. If shore features
    be submerged instead of elevated, they furnish less accessible, though
    not less real, evidence of the change of level. Similar features
    about lakes have a like significance, but in this case it is often
    demonstrable that it is the water rather than the land which has
    changed its level.</p>

  <h4><i>Effect of Shore-deposition on Coastal Configuration.</i></h4>

  <p>The tendency of shore-deposition is to cut off bays and to straighten
    and simplify the shore-lines. This is abundantly illustrated along
    the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States (see <a href="#fig319"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 319</a> and
    <a href="#plate_XXIIa"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXII</a>). It is to be noted, however, that in the simplification of
    the shore-line through deposition, the initial stages often result
    in great irregularity (<a href="#fig320"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 320</a> and <a href="#plate_XXIIIa"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXIII</a>). In some cases, the
    irregularities are not temporary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span> Thus deltas (<a href="#Page_198"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 198</a>), though
    not wholly the work of sea- (or lake-) water, often constitute
    irregularities of a more or less permanent nature. This is the case
    where they project beyond the general trend of the coast-line. Where,
    on the other hand, they are built at the heads of bays, they tend to
    simplify the coast-line by obliterating the indentation. The delta at
    the head of the Gulf of California is an example. So too is the delta
    of the Mississippi, the real head of which is far above the present
    debouchure of the stream. The form of the delta in ground-plan depends
    on the horizontal configuration of the coast where it is developed, on
    the strength of the waves and shore-currents, and on their relation
    to the amount of detritus contributed by the stream concerned. Good
    illustrations are furnished by the Gulf of Mexico where the deltas of
    the Mississippi and Rio Grande are in contrast.</p>

  <p>So far as concerns the vertical configuration of coasts, erosion and
    deposition are in contrast, for while the former tends to develop
    steep, irregular, and often high slopes (<a href="#Page_349"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 349</a>) from the land to
    the sea, the latter tends to develop gentle, regular, and low ones.
    A partial exception to the latter part of this general statement
    comes about through the building of dunes, the material for which is
    furnished by the waves.</p>

  <h3>SUMMARY OF COASTAL IRREGULARITIES.</h3>

  <p>The horizontal irregularities of coasts are both large and small.
    Some of them, like Florida, Sandy Hook, etc., consist primarily of
    projections of land into the sea; others, like Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf
    of Mexico, and Puget Sound, are projections of the sea into the land;
    while still others, like the Gulf of California and its associated
    peninsula, cannot readily be put in either of the foregoing classes.
    Some of the irregularities of the land border, such as Yucatan, are
    more or less nearly normal to the general trend of the coast which they
    affect, while others, such as the “beaches” along the Atlantic and
    Gulf coasts of the United States (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig319">319</a> and <a href="#fig320">320</a>), are more or less
    nearly parallel with it. Some of the irregularities, especially some of
    the small ones, are more or less angular in their outline (<a href="#plate_XX"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XX</a> and
    parts of <a href="#plate_XXIIb"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXII</a>), while others are bounded by curves instead.</p>

  <p>In many cases more than one factor has been involved in the development
    of irregularities. In the case of great irregularities, diastrophism
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>has generally been the dominant factor. The Gulf of Mexico and the
    Mediterranean Sea perhaps represent differential subsidence, while
    Florida and the Iberian peninsula represent differential uplift
    (relative, though perhaps not absolute). The narrow bays which indent
    many coasts generally represent the subsidence of a region previously
    affected by valleys (<a href="#fig297"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 297</a>). Many of them, such as Narragansett,
    Delaware, and Chesapeake Bays, are primarily the drowned ends of
    river valleys, while others, such as Puget Sound,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> are primarily
    structural valleys (synclines). Many of the long and narrow bays or
    fiords common in the high latitudes of North America and Europe (<a href="#fig266"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    266</a>, <a href="#Page_293"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 293</a>) appear to be the drowned ends of valleys previously
    deepened by glaciers. The drowned ends of river canyons, and the
    submerged parts of valleys excavated (not sunk) beneath the sea by
    glaciers, would also be fiords.</p>

    <figcaption>PORTION OF THE COAST OF MAINE.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The processes which develop coastal indentations, together with the
    antecedent subaërial and the subsequent wave gradation, account for
    most of the islands which affect indented coasts. Some of them are
    high and some low for reasons which will be readily understood. The
    long narrow belts of land constituting irregularities parallel to the
    general trend of the coast (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig319">319</a> and <a href="#fig320">320</a>) are usually the result
    of deposition in shallow water. They are usually sand or coral reefs,
    built up above water-level by waves. The deposits at the debouchures
    of streams give rise to projecting deltas. Most small irregularities
    of angular form, especially if high (<a href="#plate_XX"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XX</a>), indicate wave-erosion,
    and their details of form are determined by the structure of the rock
    along shore, while most irregularities of curved outline involve
    something of shore-deposition, if not due wholly to it. Glaciation, or
    glaciation and subsidence, may also give rise to peninsulas, capes, and
    islands of curved outlines (<a href="#plate_XXIV"><abbr title="Plate">Pl.</abbr> XXIV</a>, coast of Maine). Curving outlines
    may, however, be developed by erosion alone in weak rock structures.
    This is illustrated by the weak rock structures (clay, sand, etc.) of
    most of the Atlantic coastal plain. Thus inspection of the horizontal
    configuration of coasts will often indicate the processes which
    have been dominant there in recent times. On the other hand, the
    interpretations of many coastal irregularities, such as Hudson Bay,
    Puget Sound, the Gulf of California, the Baltic Sea, etc., are not to
    be read from the map. In such cases, diastrophism and gradation have
    usually coöperated, but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>the relative importance of the two processes
    can only be determined by detailed study in the field. When it is
    remembered that the tendency of shore-erosion is to reduce great
    irregularities of horizontal configuration, though not to obliterate
    small ones if the coast be heterogeneous in composition (<a href="#Page_353"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 353</a>), and
    that the tendency of shore-deposition is also to regularity, it is
    clear that the great irregularities of coast-lines are due neither to
    shore-erosion nor to shore-deposition, though minor ones may be due to
    either.</p>

  <h3>THE WORK OF OCEAN-CURRENTS.</h3>

  <p>As agents of erosion, ocean-currents are not, in general, of great
    importance. Currents which reach the bottom are comparable, in
    their effects, to rivers of the same velocity and volume; but most
    ocean-currents do not touch bottom, and, therefore, do not erode it.
    Where the current agitates the bottom sensibly, as it often does in
    shallow water, the bottom is abraded, and in the lee of such places
    it is doubtless aggraded. Since ocean-currents do not, for the most
    part, flow in shallow water, their erosive work is, on the whole,
    relatively slight; but where they are forced through narrow and shallow
    passageways, their abrasive work may be considerable. Thus the Gulf
    Stream, where it issues from the Gulf, has a velocity of four or five
    miles per hour, and its shallow and narrow channel is current-swept.</p>

  <p>A rough test of the abrasive work of an ocean-current is found in the
    nature of the bottom beneath it. If this be hard, it indicates that the
    loose sediment on the floor of the ocean has been swept away, while the
    presence of fine detritus indicates that the current is not wearing.
    Thus the abrasive power of the Gulf Stream is known to continue
    somewhat beyond its narrow channel, for on the Blake plateau (between
    the Bahamas and Cape Hatteras), where the water is 600 fathoms and less
    in depth, “the bottom of the Gulf Stream ... is swept clean of lime and
    ooze and is nearly barren of animal life.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Other illustrations
    of the erosive power of currents have been noted near Gibraltar in
    water 500 fathoms deep, and between the Canary Islands at depths of
    1000 fathoms.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> In spite of these examples, and of many others
    which probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span> exist in similar situations, it yet remains true that
    ocean-currents are on the whole but feeble agents of erosion.</p>

  <p>As agents of transportation, ocean-currents are scarcely more important
    than as agents of corrasion, for they transport only what they erode,
    if the life which inhabits them be left out of consideration. This
    phase of their work has probably been exaggerated through a confusion
    of transporting energy and actual transportation. Ocean-currents which
    do not touch bottom roll no sediment and carry only what may be held
    in suspension. A river’s power of transporting sediment in suspension
    is due largely to the cross-currents occasioned by the unevenness of
    its resistant bottom (<a href="#Page_117"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 117</a>). If a particle of mud in suspension in
    a river drops to the bottom, as it frequently does, it may be picked
    up again and carried forward. If, on the other hand, a particle in
    suspension in an ocean-current once escapes the moving water by
    settling through it, the current which does not drag bottom has no
    chance to pick it up again. Very fine sediment may be carried by an
    ocean-current far beyond the point where it was acquired, but currents
    which do not touch bottom are rarely strong enough to hold any but the
    finest material for any considerable length of time. As transporters
    of sediment, therefore, ocean-currents are at a great disadvantage as
    compared with rivers.</p>

  <p>How readily particles of extreme fineness may be kept in suspension,
    and how little agitation is necessary to keep them from sinking, is
    shown by the experiments of Sorby, who showed that while a sand grain
    ¹⁄₁₀₀ of an inch in diameter will settle one foot per second in still
    water, fine particles of clay require days to sink through the same
    distance. The Challenger found fine sediment derived from the land 400
    miles from the coast of Africa, and that not opposite the debouchure of
    any large river. Sediment settles more readily in salt water than in
    fresh, despite the fact that the former is heavier. This is presumably
    because the salt diminishes the cohesion of the water.</p>

  <p>Deposition by ocean-currents is limited by their transportation. Only
    where they erode their bottoms do they gather coarse materials, and
    only in the lee of such places are their deposits coarse. Since the
    material which they carry is generally fine, it is widely distributed
    before deposition.</p>

  <p>Ocean-currents have little influence on the configuration of
    coast-lines.</p>

  <h3>DEPOSITS ON THE OCEAN-BED.</h3>

  <p>Something has already been said concerning the sediments which
    accumulate in the shallow waters along shores; but the area of marine
    sedimentation is as extensive as the ocean itself, and the deposits
    must now be reviewed from another point of view.</p>

  <p>Oceanic deposits may be conveniently divided into two chief groups,
    dependent on the depth of the water in which they are made.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> These
    groups are (1) <i>shallow-water deposits</i>, made in water less than
    some such depth as 100 fathoms, and (2) <i>deep-sea deposits</i>, laid
    down in water of greater depth. The selection of the 100-fathom line as
    the dividing depth is less arbitrary than it seems, for passing outward
    from the shore, it is at about this depth that the bottom ceases to be
    commonly disturbed by the action of currents and waves; that sunlight
    and vegetable life cease to be important at the bottom; and that the
    coarser sediments which predominate along shore give place, as a rule,
    to muds and oozes. Furthermore, the 100-fathom line (or some line very
    near it) is an important one in the physical relief of the globe, for
    it appears to mark, approximately, the junction of continental plateaus
    and ocean-basins. Only because the latter are a little over-full does
    the water run over their rims, covering about 10,000,000 square miles
    of the borders of the continents, converting them from land into
    epicontinental seas.</p>

  <p>Aside from the deposits made by organisms, shallow-water deposits
    are divisible into two groups—(<i>a</i>) those immediately along the
    shore, the <i>littoral deposits</i>, and (<i>b</i>) those made between
    the littoral zone and the 100-fathom line. Both are terrigenous. The
    deep-sea deposits likewise are divisible into two groups, (<i>a</i>)
    <i>terrigenous deposits</i> formed close to land, and made up chiefly
    of materials derived immediately from the disintegration of land
    formations; and (<i>b</i>) the <i>pelagic deposits</i>, made up chiefly
    of the remains of pelagic organisms and the ultimate products arising
    from the decomposition of rocks and minerals. The former predominate in
    the less deep waters relatively near shore; the latter in the deeper
    water far from land. The shallow- and deep-water deposits grade into
    each other in a belt along the 100-fathom line.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>
  <h4><i>Shallow-water Deposits.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Littoral deposits.—</b>The littoral zone is the zone between high-
    and low-water marks. It is the zone in which bowlders, gravels, sands,
    and all coarser materials accumulate, though muds are occasionally met
    with in sheltered estuaries. Generally speaking, the nature of these
    deposits is determined by the character of the adjoining lands and the
    nature of the local organisms. “The heavier materials brought by rivers
    from high terrestrial regions, or thrown up by the tides and waves
    of the sea, are here arranged with great diversity of stratification
    through the alternate play of the winds and waves. Twice in the
    twenty-four hours the littoral zone is covered by water and exposed
    to the direct rays of the sun or the cooling effects of the night.
    There is a great range of temperature; mechanical agencies produce
    their maximum effects,”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and physical conditions in general are
    most varied. Still greater diversity is introduced by the fact that
    the zone is inhabited by both marine and terrestrial organisms, while
    the evaporation of the sea-water which flows over tidal marshes and
    lagoons leads to the formation of saline deposits. If the length of
    the coast-lines of the world be taken at 125,000 miles (about 200,000
    kilometers), and the average width of this zone at half a mile, these
    deposits are now forming over an area of 62,500 square miles (about
    160,000 square kilometers) of the earth’s surface.</p>

  <p><b>Non-littoral, mechanical deposits in shallow water.—</b>These
    deposits are laid down in the zone of the ocean between low-water mark
    and the 100-fathom line. They cover about 10,000,000 square miles.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
    Their composition is much the same as that of the littoral deposits,
    with which they are continuous, though on the whole they are finer. At
    their lower limit they pass insensibly into the fine deposits of the
    deep sea. Coarse material, such as gravel and sand, prevails, though
    in special situations, such as depressions and inclosed basins, muddy
    deposits are found. While some of the deposits are wholly composed
    of inorganic débris, organic remains are freely mingled with others.
    The mechanical effects of tides, currents, and waves are everywhere
    present, but become less and less well marked as the 100-fathom line
    is approached. The forms of vegetable and animal life are numerous,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>though the former decrease as depths which exclude the sunlight are
    approached.</p>

  <p>Both littoral deposits and deposits in shallow water outside the
    littoral zone have already been referred to in connection with the work
    of waves and currents (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 355–66). A few additional points only need
    here be added.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In general the coarser sediments are lodged near shore and those
    farther from the land become progressively finer. Even the coarser
    part of the material carried in suspension by the undertow is partly
    left in the shallow water. On the other hand, waves of exceptional
    strength may carry coarse material into water of some depth. Thus
    coarse shingle (gravel) and even bowlders have been found at depths of
    10 fathoms.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Coarse deposits may extend far out from land if the
    waves are strong, and especially if the water is shallow, and since
    the zone of shallow water may be extended seaward by the aggradation
    of the bottom, shallow-water deposits may cover extensive areas. They
    may become deep at the same time, for as the outer border of the
    shallow-water zone is shifted seaward by aggradation, the vertical
    space to be filled becomes greater (compare <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig321">321</a> and <a href="#fig321">322</a>).
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>Again, if the coast be sinking, new deposits of coarse material may
    be made on older ones. In this way also great thicknesses of sediment
    may be accumulated, all parts of which were deposited in shallow water.
    The great thickness of some of the conglomerate beds of the past shows
    how far this process may go.</p>

  <p>As a rule, no definite line marks the seaward terminus of the coarse
    detritus, since coarse material is carried farther out when the waves
    run high (and the undertow is strong) than when they are feeble. In
    calm weather, therefore, fine sediment may be deposited where coarse
    had been laid down in the preceding storm, only to be covered in turn
    by other deposits of a different character. Thus gravel grades off into
    sand, with more or less overlapping or interwedging, and sand grades
    off into silt in the same way. This is diagrammatically illustrated by
    <a href="#fig323"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 323</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

  <p><b>Characteristics of shallow-water deposits.—</b>Clastic sediments
    laid down in shallow water have several distinctive characteristics.
    While they are, in the aggregate, coarse, they are characterized by
    frequent variations in coarseness. The surfaces of successive beds
    are likely to be ripple- and rill-marked (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig324">324</a>, <a href="#fig325">325</a>, <a href="#fig326">326</a>), and
    cross-bedding (<a href="#fig327"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 327</a>) is of common occurrence. Clayey sediments
    accumulated between high and low water are often sun-cracked (<a href="#fig328"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    328</a>), and the tracks of land animals are sometimes preserved on their
    surfaces. Shallow-water deposits often contain fossils of organisms
    which live in waters of slight depth. These characteristics are
    sufficient to differentiate sedimentary formations made in shallow
    water from those made in deep water, even after they have been
    converted into solid rock and after the rock has emerged from the sea.
    Many of these characteristics are, however, shared by deposits made by
    streams on the land. Subaërial and lacustrine sediments are usually
    distinguishable from those made in the sea by their fossils, and
    sometimes by their distribution.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

  <p><b>Topography of shallow-water deposits.—</b>The shallow-water deposits
    have, on the whole, a rather plane surface, though there are some
    notable departures from flatness. The steep slopes of the delta fronts
    and of wave-built terraces have already been spoken of. Barriers often
    shut in depressions, and the disposition of the material deposited is
    sometimes uneven, owing to shore and tidal currents. The result is that
    the surface of the shallow-water deposits is often affected by low
    elevations and by shallow depressions. The elevations and depressions
    may be elongate, circular, or irregular in form. These general facts
    are shown in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig319">319</a>, <a href="#fig320">320</a>, and <a href="#fig329">329</a>. This topography is sometimes
    preserved on newly emerged lands, as at various points on the Coastal
    Plain of the United States.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

  <p><b>Chemical and organic deposits.—</b>There is no sharp line of
    distinction between the deposits usually classed as chemical and
    those regarded as organic. The latter are chemical in the broader
    sense of the term, but as they are immediately associated with life
    and are dependent upon it, it is a matter of practical convenience to
    separate them. Aside from the organic deposits, the chemical deposits
    made in shallow sea-water embrace (1) those due to reactions between
    constituents so brought together that new and insoluble compounds are
    formed and precipitated, and (2) those due to evaporation. The points
    of saturation for the various substances dissolved in sea-water are
    reached at different stages, and hence they are deposited more or less
    in succession.</p>

  <p>The chemical deposits made in the shallow water of the sea, or in
    shallow bodies of water isolated from the sea, are chiefly simple
    precipitates resulting from evaporation; but new combinations are
    sometimes made in the process of concentration and precipitation.
    All substances in solution are necessarily precipitated on complete
    evaporation, but since the sea-water is in general far from saturation,
    so far as all its leading salts are concerned, only a few are thrown
    down in quantity sufficient to have geological importance where
    evaporation is incomplete. The leading deposits are lime carbonate
    (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), lime sulphate (gypsum, CaSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O), common salt
    (rock-salt, NaCl), and the magnesium salts, usually the chlorides and
    sulphates, which are later changed to carbonates. In investigations
    on Mediterranean water<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> which had an initial density of 1.02, no
    deposit took place until concentration by evaporation had brought the
    water to a specific gravity of 1.05. Between this density and that
    of 1.13, lime carbonate and some iron oxide were deposited. Between
    1.13 and 1.22, lime sulphate was the most abundant precipitate, while
    between 1.22 and 1.31, 95% of the deposit was common salt. With still
    further concentration, the remaining substances in solution, especially
    the magnesium salts, were thrown down.</p>

  <p>While there is somewhat more than ten times as much lime sulphate as
    lime carbonate in the ocean (<a href="#Page_324"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 324</a>), the deposits of the carbonate
    (including the organic) have been very much greater than those of the
    sulphate. This is due partly to the fact that the sulphate is much more
    soluble in natural waters than the carbonate. Rivers bring much more
    carbonate than sulphate to the sea, so that the point of saturation for
    the sulphate would normally be reached much later <span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>than that of the
    carbonate. The more important fact, however, is that marine plants and
    animals use lime carbonate freely for skeletal and housing purposes.
    It is held by some that they get their lime from the sulphate, but if
    so they convert it into carbonate before it takes the form of shells,
    coral, etc., the sulphuric acid set free in the process reproducing,
    directly or indirectly, more sulphate. The secretion of lime carbonate
    by organisms is not dependent on the saturation of the water, but may
    be carried on when the amount in solution is very small.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that the chief deposits of lime carbonate
    have been and are being made through the agency of plants and animals
    in the form of shells, coral, bones, teeth, and other devices for
    supporting, stiffening, housing, protecting, and arming themselves;
    but while it is agreed that the larger part of the lime carbonate
    deposited in the open sea is of organic origin, it is equally clear
    that in closed seas subject to concentration from evaporation, simple
    precipitation takes place freely. There is some difference of opinion
    as to the importance of these two classes of deposits, past and
    present. The debated point is whether simple precipitation takes place
    in any appreciable degree under the usual oceanic conditions. There is
    much more evidence of solution by sea-water than of precipitation from
    it. The ocean appears to be under-saturated with lime carbonate on the
    whole, though it is still possible that deposition may take place in
    favorable situations, as, for example, where the very calcareous waters
    of rivers are spread out in thin sheets on the surface of the heavier
    salt water, and thus exposed to exceptional evaporation, or where there
    is very exceptional agitation and aëration.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

  <p>Gypsum appears to be deposited in quantity only in the closed basins of
    arid regions where concentration reaches an advanced state.</p>

  <p>Since normal sea-water is far from saturation with common salt,
    the latter is precipitated only in lagoons, closed seas, or other
    situations favorable to great concentration. This is usually achieved
    only in notably arid regions, and in basins that receive little or no
    drainage from the land.</p>

  <p>Deposits of salt usually, therefore, signify highly arid conditions,
    and where they occur over wide ranges in latitude and longitude, as
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>in certain periods of the past, unusual aridity is inferred. Where
    confined to limited areas, their climatic significance is less, for
    topographic conditions may determine local aridity. The total area
    where salt is now being precipitated is small, though on the whole
    the present is probably to be regarded as a rather arid period of the
    earth’s history. On the other hand, ancient deposits of salt preserved
    in the sedimentary strata show that the area of salt deposition has
    been much more considerable than now at one time and another in the
    earth’s history. The salt and gypsum deposits of the past seem,
    therefore, to tell an interesting tale of the climates of the past.</p>

  <p>The magnesium salts are among the last to be thrown down as the
    sea-water is evaporated, and they most commonly take the form of
    sulphates and chlorides. They often form double salts with potassium,
    a relatively small and soluble constituent of sea-water. In the
    artificial evaporation of salt water to obtain common salt, the process
    is usually stopped before the saturation-point for the magnesium salts
    is reached, and the residue, the “mother-liquor,” or “bittern,” is
    drawn off to prevent these “bitter” salts from mixing with the common
    salt. The magnesium salts are among the last to be precipitated, not
    only because they are readily soluble, but because their quantity is
    small; yet in the original rock from which all the sea-salts came,
    there is at least as much magnesium as sodium, while in the sea there
    is about five times as much sodium as magnesium. Just what becomes of
    the remaining magnesium is not yet well understood. It has a notable
    disposition to form double salts with some other constituent, as noted
    above. In the earlier marine strata, dolomite, that is, limestone
    composed partly or wholly of the double carbonate of lime and magnesia,
    (CaMg)CO<sub>3</sub>, abounds. This appears to have been formed by a gradual
    substitution of molecules of magnesium for those of calcium, but
    just how and when and why it was done has not been fully worked out.
    It appears to be a case where the saline matter of the sea made its
    contribution to the sedimentary deposits by chemical reaction upon
    them, rather than by precipitation because of saturation.</p>

  <p>The relatively small amount of potash in the sea-water is probably due
    to its disposition to remain united with the clays and earths of the
    mantle rock and of the shaley deposits.</p>

  <p>To some extent the salts in solution act directly on the earthy matter
    brought down into the sea by rivers, but where sedimentation is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span> rapid,
    as it often is in shallow water, this action is limited and obscure.
    In the main, the ocean-waters protect the sediments from weathering
    and similar changes, except as organic matter buried with them induces
    change.</p>

  <p>While the lime deposits are by far the greatest of the chemical and
    organic deposits of the sea, plants and animals also secrete notable
    quantities of silica. Silica deposits of organic origin are relatively
    much more important in the deep sea than in shallow water, and will be
    mentioned in that connection.</p>

  <p><b>Limestone.—</b>Something concerning the origin of limestone has
    already been given in the preceding paragraphs, but because of the
    importance of this formation, it may be added by way of summary that
    shallow seas free, or nearly free, from terrigenous sediment, and
    abounding in lime-secreting life, furnish the conditions for nearly
    pure deposits of limestone, and that most of the limestone within the
    areas of the present continents appears to have originated under such
    conditions. The common notion that limestone is normally a deep-water
    formation is a serious error. Although limestones are formed in deep
    as well as in shallow waters, by far the more important classes of
    lime-secreting organisms are photobathic, i.e. are limited to the
    depths to which light penetrates. In the shallow waters, these plants
    and animals are in part free and in part attached. Within the areas of
    deep water they are free and at the surface, and their remains drop to
    the bottom, if not sooner dissolved. But few forms live on the deep,
    dark, cold bottoms of abysmal depths. Clear waters, free from abundant
    terrigenous sediments and abounding in lime-secreting life, rather than
    deep waters, are, therefore, the most favorable conditions for the
    origin of limestone.</p>

  <p>The purely chemical deposits of limestone are probably all of
    shallow-water origin. Once made, they are subject to solution,
    redeposition, and other mutations like other deposits. As a result,
    they often lose many of their original characteristics, but enough
    usually remain to tell the story of their origin.</p>

  <h4><i>Deep-sea Deposits.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Contrasted with shallow-water deposits.—</b>The deep-sea deposits
    cover the ocean-bottom below the 100-fathom line. Their area is
    considerably more than half the earth’s surface. The characteristic
    deposits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span> are muds, organic oozes, and clays, which in their physical
    characteristics are remarkably uniform. In regions of floating ice,
    greater diversity is introduced from the varied nature of the materials
    which the ice transports, but gravels and sands, comparable to those of
    shallow water, are rarely found. “Tides, currents, and waves produce
    some mechanical effects at the upper limits of the deep-sea region,
    but on the whole there is an absence of the phenomena of erosion, and
    mechanical action would appear to be absent except in the case of
    submarine eruptions. The depth is too great for sunlight to penetrate,
    and vegetable life is limited to the upper zone. Animal life is present
    in the same zone and on the bottom, but absent or nearly so in the
    middle depths. The temperature (at the bottom) is below 40° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>
    throughout the larger part of the area, and if subject to variation
    with latitude or change of season, these changes affect only the depths
    immediately beyond the 100-fathom line. Throughout the whole region
    there is a very uniform set of conditions. In the shallow-water and
    littoral zones, owing to the rapid accumulation and the mechanical
    effects of transportation and erosion, the effects of chemical
    modification are not very apparent in the deposits; but in deep-sea
    deposits, in consequence of the less rapid rate of accumulation,
    absence of transport, the nature and small size of the particles, many
    evident chemical reactions have taken place, resulting in the formation
    <i>in situ</i> of glauconite, phosphatic and manganese nodules,
    zeolites, and other secondary products.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> With increasing depth and
    distance from the shore, the character of the deposits undergoes a
    change. There is less and less material derived directly from the land,
    and more “amorphous matter arising from the ultimate decomposition
    of minerals and rocks, and accompanied, in all moderate depths, by
    an increase [relative] of the remains of pelagic organisms. We thus
    pass insensibly from those deep-sea deposits of a terrestrial origin,
    which we call ‘terrigenous,’ to those deep-sea deposits denominated
    ‘pelagic,’ in which the remains of calcareous and siliceous organisms,
    clays and other substances of secondary origin play the principal
    rôle.”<a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

  <p><b>Sources.—</b>The pelagic deposits are made up in part of materials
    of organic origin, and in part of materials of inorganic origin. The
    inorganic materials may be of mechanical or chemical origin. Mechanical
    pelagic deposits originate in various ways. They may come (1) from the
    land by the ordinary processes of gradation, (2) from volcanic vents,
    or (3) from extra-terrestrial sources. Chemical deposits may be formed
    (1) <i>in situ</i> by the chemical interaction of substances in the
    sea-water on materials of organic and inorganic origin, and (2) by
    direct precipitation from the sea-water.</p>

  <p><b>Mechanical inorganic deposits.—</b>The terrigenous materials which
    reach the deep sea are, as a rule, only the finest products of land
    decay, and are carried out by movements of water or by the winds. They
    are not commonly recognized in the dredgings more than 200 miles from
    the shore, but opposite the mouths of great rivers they extend much
    farther,—1000 miles in the case of the Amazon. They are especially
    abundant on the slopes of the continental shelves. Here occur the
    <i>blue</i>, <i>green</i>, and <i>red muds</i>, with which are
    associated volcanic and coral muds. The color of these various muds is
    dependent in part on the changes which they have undergone since their
    deposition. The green muds usually contain enough glauconite to give
    them their color, and are most commonly found off bold coasts where
    sedimentation is not rapid. The blue muds indicate lack of oxidation,
    or perhaps deoxidation. Red muds are not common, though they have been
    found in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span> situations. In general, these deposits are analogous to
    certain shales, marls, etc., found within the continents.</p>

  <p>Though coarse materials derived from the land are occasionally found in
    the deep-sea deposits, their presence must be looked upon as in some
    sense accidental. Occasional pebbles, or even bowlders, are carried out
    into the ocean entangled in the roots of floating trees. Within limits,
    too, icebergs have carried out land débris, though it is probable that
    transportation by this means has been exaggerated. The amount which
    icebergs might carry, if fully loaded, is far greater than the amount
    which they do carry.</p>

  <p>Of the identifiable inorganic materials in the deep sea, the most
    abundant are of volcanic origin, and among these the most common is
    pumice, which is frequently so light that it floats readily until it
    becomes water-logged. Pieces of pumice brought up by the Challenger and
    thoroughly dried were found to float for months in sea-water before
    settling even through the depth of water contained in the vessel
    in which the experiment was performed.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The next most abundant
    substance of volcanic origin in pelagic deposits is <i>volcanic
    glass</i>. This ranges from pieces of the size of a walnut down to
    the smallest fragments, which often serve as centers for concretions.
    <i>Lapilli</i> (cinders) and <i>volcanic ash</i> also are abundant in
    parts of the deep sea. The distribution of these volcanic products is
    essentially universal, though by no means uniform. Some of them are
    probably from submarine volcanoes.</p>

  <p>The study of the deep sea deposits has revealed the presence of many
    nodules and grains which are believed to be of extra-terrestrial
    origin. Many of them are magnetic.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> The dust of countless meteors
    which enter the atmosphere daily settles on land and sea alike, and
    enters into the sediment of the bottom of the latter. It is probably
    no more abundant in deep water than in shallow, but it is relatively
    more important, since other sedimentation is more meager. The number of
    meteorites which enter the atmosphere daily has been estimated at from
    15,000,000 to 20,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> If on the average the meteorites weigh
    ten grains each, probably a rather high estimate, the total amount of
    extra-terrestrial matter reaching the earth yearly would be 5,000 to
    7,000 tons, and something like three-fourths of this must, on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>the
    average, fall into the sea. But even at this rate it would take some
    fifty billion years to cover the sea-bottom with a layer one foot in
    thickness.</p>

  <p><b>Organic constituents of pelagic deposits.—</b>With increasing
    distance from shores, and especially with increasing depth of water,
    terrigenous deposits become less and less abundant, and sediments
    derived from pelagic life increase in relative importance. Beyond
    the upper part of the outer slopes of the continental shelves, the
    pelagic deposits are largely made up of shells and skeletons of
    marine organisms which live in the surface-waters. Pelagic molluscs,
    foraminifera, and algæ secrete shells of lime carbonate, while diatoms
    and radiolarians secrete shells of silica. When the organisms die,
    they sink to the bottom with their shells, and these mineral matters
    of organic origin are mingled with the volcanic products which are
    universal over the sea-floor. Pelagic deposits of organic origin are
    named according to their characteristic constituents. Thus there are
    pteropod oozes, globigerina oozes, diatom oozes, radiolarian oozes,
    etc.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> It is not to be understood that these oozes are made up
    exclusively of the shells which give them their names. Diatom ooze is
    an ooze in which diatom shells are abundant, not an ooze made up wholly
    of diatom shells; and globigerina ooze is an ooze in which globigerina
    shells are abundant, though in many cases they do not make up even
    the bulk of the matter. While samples of these various oozes might be
    selected which are thoroughly distinct from one another, there are
    all gradations between them, since pelagic life does not recognize
    boundary-lines.</p>

  <p>It is a significant fact that with increasing depth the proportion
    of lime carbonate in the ooze decreases. Thus in tropical regions
    remote from land where the depths are less than 600 fathoms, the
    carbonate of lime of the shells of pelagic organisms may constitute
    80% or 90% of the deposit. With the same surface conditions, but with
    increasing depth, the percentage of lime carbonate decreases, until at
    2000 fathoms it is less than 60%; at 2400 fathoms, 30%, and at 2600
    fathoms, 10%. Beyond this depth there are usually no more than traces
    of carbonate of lime. The data at hand show that the percentage of lime
    carbonate falls off below 2200 fathoms more rapidly than at lesser
    depths.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span></p>

  <p>When the percentage of lime carbonate becomes very low, the calcareous
    oozes grade off into the red clay with which the sea-floor below 2400
    to 2600 fathoms is covered.</p>

  <p><b>Chemical deposits.—</b>The chemical deposits of the deep sea are
    chiefly the alteration products of sediments which reach the sea-bottom
    by mechanical means. All sediment deposited in the sea undergoes
    more or less chemical change, but it is only when the change is
    very considerable that the product is referred to this class. Where
    sedimentation is rapid and the sediment coarse, the chemical change is
    relatively slight; but where the sedimentation is slow and the sediment
    fine, the chemical change is relatively great; for the longer exposure
    to the sea-water and the greater proportion of surface exposed to
    attack, both favor change. Both the area and the mass of sea-bottom
    sediment radically changed in this way are large, but most of the
    deposit does not correspond to any formation known on the land.</p>

  <p>The red clay already referred to belongs to this class of deposits.
    Its origin has been the subject of much discussion. It contains much
    volcanic débris, various concretions, bones of mammals, zeolitic
    crystals, and extra-terrestrial spherules, and doubtless the insoluble
    products of the shells of pelagic life; but it is still a mooted
    question how far the clay itself is the product of decomposed shells,
    and how far the altered product of pulverized pumice, volcanic ash,
    dust, etc. Pelagic life does not seem to be less abundant at the
    surface where the water is deep than where it is shallow, and it would
    appear that the shells must sink in such situations as elsewhere. If
    the lime carbonate of globigerina ooze be removed by dilute acid, the
    inorganic residue is similar to the red clay in the ocean-bottom. This
    suggests that owing to the more complete solution in the very deep
    water, the lime carbonate of the shells has been dissolved, leaving
    the red clay as a residuum. The more complete solution at the bottom
    might be the result either of the greater pressure, or of a greater
    percentage of CO<sub>2</sub> in the water due to emanations from the sea-floor,
    or to both; but the suddenness of the transition from oozes to red
    clay, with increasing depth, does not seem to be fully explained by
    these assumptions. The study of the dredgings has inclined the students
    of these materials to the conclusion that volcanic materials, rather
    than shells, are the principal source of the red clay.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>The
    volcanic materials are thought to have accumulated slowly and to have
    been long exposed to the action of sea-water. The various nodules
    and crystals in the clay are believed to be secondary products, the
    materials for which were derived from the decomposition of the same
    materials. Eolian dust may be a notable constituent of the red clay.</p>

  <p>Various specific products of chemical change may be briefly referred
    to. The decomposition of certain mineral particles, such as feldspar,
    gives rise to <i>kaolin</i>, and kaolin is a very considerable
    constituent of most of the clayey deposits of the ocean-bottom. The
    kaolinization of feldspar may take place both on land and in the sea.
    <i>Manganiferous</i> deposits are widespread in the ocean-bottom,
    occurring both as coatings on grains of mechanical sediments, shells,
    etc., and as concretions ranging in sizes from minute particles to
    nodules an inch or more in diameter. The concretions are sometimes
    approximately spheroidal, but often botryoidal. These manganiferous
    nodules are believed to have arisen from the decay of fragments of
    volcanic rocks. In their decay, the manganese and iron are believed
    to have been first changed to carbonates, and subsequently to oxides.
    After manganese oxide, iron oxide and silica are by far the most
    abundant constituents, but many other substances enter into their
    composition in minor quantities.</p>

  <p>Another substance somewhat widely distributed in the sea-bed, though
    by no means universal, is <i>glauconite</i>, a complex silicate of
    alumina, iron, potassium, etc. Glauconite is, on the whole, most
    abundant along the edges of the continental shelves, though it is by
    no means universal in this position. It is not commonly found in deep
    water, nor very near the shore, but approximately at the “mud-line.”
    The glauconite grains begin to form, as a rule, in tiny shells,
    chiefly the shells of foraminifera. After filling the shell, the shell
    itself may disappear, while the glauconite goes on accumulating around
    the core already formed, until the grain attains considerable size.
    Glauconite is believed to be an alteration product of certain sorts
    of mechanical sediment, the change being effected under the influence
    of the decaying organic matter in the shells.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> It does not occur
    where sedimentation is rapid, and its formation appears to be favored
    by considerable changes of temperature. Glauconite deposits occur on
    the land and are commonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span> known as <i>green sand marl</i>. Glauconite
    also occurs sparingly in many other sedimentary rocks.</p>

    deep-sea deposits. (Murray. Challenger Reports.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Another substance which is somewhat widespread in the ocean-bottom is
    <i>phosphate of lime</i>, which occurs in various sorts of oozes, in
    the manganiferous nodules, in glauconite, and in independent nodules.
    Like the grains of glauconite, the grains of phosphate of lime appear
    to have started as concretions in shells, and to be the result of the
    reaction of organic matter on the contents of sea-water. The immediate
    source of the lime phosphate in the water appears to have been the
    shells or bones of the numerous animals living in the sea.</p>

  <p>Secondary minerals made from the constituents of volcanic matter
    which has been decomposed occur not uncommonly in the bottom of the
    sea. These minerals belong to the general class of <i>zeolites</i>,
    phillipsite being the most abundant. Their distribution is somewhat
    wide, but their quantity is slight.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, knowledge of the deep-sea deposits is limited to their
    superficial layers. Soundings do not usually penetrate more than a few
    inches, or at most a foot or two.</p>

  <p>Unlike shallow-water deposits, those of the really deep sea seem to
    find no correlatives in the known rock formations of the land.</p>

  <h3>LAKES.</h3>

  <p>Most of the phenomena of the ocean are repeated on a smaller scale
    in lakes. The waves of lakes and their attendant undertows and
    littoral currents are governed by the same laws and do the same
    sort of work as the corresponding movements of the ocean. Tides
    are absent, or insignificant, but slight changes of level, known
    as <i>seiches</i>,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> have been observed in many lakes. They are
    probably caused by sudden changes in atmospheric pressure. While they
    are generally very slight, they frequently amount to as much as a
    foot, and occasionally to several feet. The seiches are oscillatory
    movements, and their period is influenced by the length and depth
    of the lake. They have been studied most carefully in Switzerland.
    Currents corresponding to those of the ocean are slight or wanting in
    lakes, but since most lakes have inlets and outlets, their waters are
    in constant movement toward the latter. In most cases this movement
    is too slow to be readily noted, or to do effective work either in
    corrasion or transportation. The work of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>ice, on the other hand,
    is relatively more important in lakes than in the sea.</p>

  <p><b>Changes taking place in lakes.—</b>The processes in operation in
    lakes are easily observed and readily understood. (1) The waves wear
    the shores, and the material thus derived is transported, assorted,
    and deposited as in the sea, and all the topographic forms resulting
    from erosion or deposition along the seacoast are reproduced on their
    appropriate scale in lakes. (2) Streams bear their burden of gravel,
    sand, and mud into lakes and leave it there. (3) The winds blow dust
    and sand into the lakes, and in some places pile the sand up into dunes
    along the shores. (4) Animals of various sorts live in the lakes, and
    their shells and bones give rise to deposits comparable to the animal
    deposits in the sea. (5) Abundant plants grow in the shallow water
    about the borders of many ponds and lakes, and as they die, their
    substance accumulates on the bottom. (6) At the outlet the water is
    constantly lowering its channel. The lowering of the outlet is often
    slow, especially if the rock be coherent, for the outflowing water
    is usually clear, and therefore inefficient in corrasive work. These
    six processes are essentially universal, and all conspire against the
    perpetuity of the lakes. (7) In lakes where the temperature is low
    enough for ice to be formed, it crowds on the shores and develops
    phenomena peculiar to itself. The ice of the sea may work in similar
    ways, but its work is restricted to high latitudes. (8) In lakes in
    arid regions, deposits are often made by precipitation from solution.
    The first five and the last of these processes are filling the basins
    of the lakes. As the sediment is deposited, a corresponding volume
    of water is displaced, and, if there be outlets, forced out of the
    basins; the sixth process is equally antagonistic to the lakes, while
    the seventh has little influence on their permanence. Given time
    enough, these processes must bring the history of any lake to an end.
    The lowering of the outlet will alone accomplish this result if the
    bottom of the basin is above base-level. Many lakes have already become
    extinct, either through the filling or draining of their basins, or
    through both combined. The antagonism of rivers and lakes long ago
    led to the epigram “Rivers are the mortal enemies of lakes.” True as
    this statement is, it does not follow that lakes will ever cease to
    exist, for the causes which produce new lakes may be in operation
    contemporaneously with those which bring lakes now in existence to an end.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

  <p><b>Lacustrine deposits.—</b>The beds of sediment deposited in lakes are
    similar in kind, in structure, and in disposition to beds of sediment
    laid down in the sea, but river-borne sediment is more commonly
    concentrated into deltas, since waves and shore-currents are less
    effective. Even the limestone of the sea has its correlative in some
    lakes. Some of it was made of the shells of fresh-water animals which
    throve where the inwash of terrigenous sediment was slight, some of
    it from the calcareous secretions of plants,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and some of it was
    precipitated from solution.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Salt and iron-ore<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> deposits are
    also sometimes made in lakes.</p>

  <p><b>Extinct lakes.—</b>The former existence of lakes where none now
    exist may be known in various ways. If the lake basin was filled,
    its former area is a flat, the beds of which bear evidence, in their
    composition, their structure, and often in their fossil contents, of
    their origin in standing water. Such a flat is commonly so situated
    topographically that the basin would be reproduced if the lacustrine
    deposits were removed. To this general rule there might be exceptions,
    as where a glacier formed one side of the basin when it was filled.
    If the lake was destroyed by the reduction of its outlet, or by the
    removal of some other barrier, such as glacier ice, or by desiccation,
    shore phenomena, such as beaches, spits, etc., may be found. In time
    such evidences are destroyed by subaërial erosion, so that they are
    most distinct soon after the lake becomes extinct.</p>

  <p>Many lakes, some of them large<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and many of them small, are known
    to have become extinct, while many others are now in their last stages,
    namely, marshes. Many others have been greatly reduced in size. Such
    reductions are often obvious where deltas are built into lakes. Thus
    the delta built by the Rhone into Lake Geneva is several miles in
    length, and has been lengthened nearly two miles since the time of
    the Roman occupation. The end of Seneca (<abbr title="New York">N.&nbsp;Y.</abbr>) lake has been crowded
    northward some two miles by deposition at its head. Similar <span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>changes
    have taken place and are now in progress in many other lakes.</p>

  <p><b>Lake ice.</b><a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>—Since fresh water is densest at 39° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, ice
    does not commonly form on the surface until the temperature from top
    to bottom is reduced to this point. Cooled below this temperature, the
    surface-water fails to sink, and with sufficient reduction freezes. If
    the lake be small, and especially if it be shallow, it is likely to
    freeze over completely in any region where the temperature is notably
    below the freezing-point for fresh water for any considerable period
    of time. It is under these circumstances that the ice becomes most
    effective.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Suppose a lake in temperate latitudes, where the range of temperature
    is considerable, to be frozen over when the temperature is 20° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>
    If now the temperature be suddenly lowered to −10°, and such change of
    temperature is not uncommon in the northern part of the United States,
    the ice contracts notably. In contracting, it either pulls away from
    the shores or cracks. If the former, the water from which the ice is
    withdrawn quickly freezes; if the latter, water rises in the cracks
    and freezes there. In either case, the ice-cover of the lake is again
    complete. If the temperature now rises to 20° the ice expands. The
    cover is now too large for the lake, and it must either crowd up on the
    shores (<a href="#fig331"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 331</a>) or arch up (wrinkle) elsewhere. It follows the one
    course or the other, or both, according to the resistance offered by
    the shore.</p>

  <p>If the water near the shore is very shallow, the ice freezes to the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>sand, gravel, and bowlders at the bottom. If the adjacent land is low,
    the ice in expanding may shove up over it, carrying the débris frozen
    in its bottom. It may even push up loose gravel and sand in front of
    its edge if they be present on the shore. Where bowlders are frozen
    to the bottom of the ice, the shoreward thrust in expanding has the
    effect of shifting them in the same direction, and even of lifting
    them a little above the normal water-level. This constant process of
    concentrating bowlders at the shore-line gives rise to the “walled”
    lakes, which are not uncommon in the northern part of the United
    States. The “wall” does not commonly extend entirely around a lake,
    though it exists at various points on the shores of many lakes. In
    making the walls, the ice shoved up by winds, especially in the spring
    when the ice is breaking up, coöperates.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

  <p>If the lake be bordered by a low marsh, the ice and frozen earth of the
    latter are really continuous with the ice of the lake, and the push of
    the latter sometimes arches up the former into distinct anticlines,
    the frozen part only being involved in the deformation. A succession
    of colder and less cold periods may give rise to a succession of such
    anticlines.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> If the shore be steep and of non-resistant material,
    the crowding of the ice produces different but not less striking
    results. Where the thrust of the ice is against a low cliff of yielding
    material, such as clay, it disturbs all above the shore-line. Where the
    cliff is sufficiently resistant, it withstands the push of the ice, and
    the ice itself is warped and broken.</p>

  <p><b>Saline lakes.—</b>A few lakes, especially in arid or semi-arid
    regions, are salt, and others are “bitter.” Beside sodium chloride,
    salt lakes usually contain magnesium chloride, and magnesium and
    calcium sulphates. “Bitter” lakes usually contain much sodium
    carbonate, as well as some sodium chloride and sulphate, and sometimes
    borax. The degrees of saltness and bitterness vary from freshness on
    the one hand to saturation on the other. The water of the Caspian Sea
    (lake) contains, on the average, less salt than that of the sea; that
    of Great Salt Lake contains about 18%; that of the Dead Sea, about 24%;
    and that of Lake Van (eastern Turkestan), the densest body of water
    known, about 33%. See accompanying table.</p>

  <p>Many salt lakes, such as the Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake, are
    descended from fresh-water ancestors, while others, like the Caspian
    and Aral Seas, are probably isolated portions of the ocean. Lakes of
    the former class have usually become salt through a decrease in the
    humidity of the region where they occur. The water begins to be salt
    when the aridity is such that evaporation from the lake exceeds its
    inflow. In this case the inflowing waters bring in small amounts of
    saline and alkaline matter, which is concentrated as evaporation takes
    place. The concentration may go on until the point of saturation is
    reached, or until chemical reactions cause precipitation. In general
    the least soluble minerals are precipitated first. Thus gypsum begins
    to be deposited from sea-water when 37% of it has been evaporated; but
    the saturation-point for salt is not reached until 93% of the water has
    been evaporated (see <a href="#Page_375"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 375</a>). The relations in lakes are similar, and
    gypsum <span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>deposits often underlie those of salt. Deposits of salt and
    other mineral matters once in solution are making in some salt lakes
    at the present time, and considerable formations of the same sort have
    been so made in the past. Buried beneath sediments of other sorts, beds
    of common salt or of other precipitates are preserved for ages. Lime
    carbonate has been precipitated in quantity from some extinct lakes
    (<a href="#fig333"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 333</a>).</p>

  <p>The lakes which originate by the isolation of portions of the sea
    are salt at the outset. If inflow exceeds evaporation, they become
    fresher and may ultimately become fresh; otherwise they remain salt.
    If evaporation exceeds inflow they diminish in size and their waters
    become more and more salt or bitter.</p>

  <p><b>Indirect effects of lakes.—</b>Lakes tend to modify the climate
    of the region where they occur, both by increasing its humidity
    and by decreasing its range of temperature. They act as reservoirs
    for surface-waters, and so tend to restrain floods and to promote
    regularity of stream flow. They purify the waters which enter them by
    allowing their sediments to settle, and so influence the work and the
    life of the waters below.</p>

  <p><b>Composition of lake-waters.—</b>The accompanying table<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> shows
    the composition of various inclosed lake-waters, and gives some idea
    of the wide range, both in kind and quantity, of the mineral matter
    held in solution by them. It is to be noted that the table shows the
    composition of the waters of exceptional, rather than common, lakes.
    The waters of fresh lakes do not depart widely from those of rivers (<a href="#Page_107"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107</a>).</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE ORIGIN AND DESCENT OF ROCKS.</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been the current opinion that the earth was once in a molten
    state, and thence cooled to a solid condition, and hence that all the
    primitive rocks were igneous. Even those who think that the earth may
    never have passed through a molten state agree that the oldest known
    rocks are either true igneous rocks, or rocks of very similar nature. A
    molten magma may, therefore, be taken as the mother state of the rocks.
    Starting with this conception, the natural order of events suggests the
    inquiries (1) how rocks are formed from molten magmas, (2) what natures
    they assume, (3) how other rocks are derived from them, (4) how still
    other rocks are derived from these derivatives, and so on. To answer
    these inquiries is to trace out the generations of rocks and learn the
    general history of rock-formation.</p>

  <p>(1) The process by which igneous rocks are formed from lavas is
    actually taking place in existing volcanoes. As these are widely
    scattered over the face of the earth, the material poured out by
    them represents different parts of the interior and varies in nature
    accordingly. This affords the means of studying the differences that
    arise from differences of material. This is a radical consideration,
    for variations in composition give rise to the most fundamental
    distinctions between rocks, though by no means the only ones. Rocks
    which have the same composition often differ greatly in texture or
    structure, owing to the varying conditions under which they were
    formed. In the solidification of rocks from the molten state, the
    rate of cooling causes many differences. A means of studying this is
    afforded by the various lava flows that are now being poured out on
    the surface under different conditions; but a more important means is
    afforded by extinct volcanoes, especially by those which have been
    deeply cut open by erosion. In certain very ancient volcanoes, not
    only have the solidified lava streams of the surface been cut across
    by erosion, but the lava that remained in the crater, or in the neck
    that led up from below, is laid bare for inspection. Exposures of even
    more profound nature have been made by the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span> disruptions which
    the outer part of the crust has suffered. In certain tracts there have
    been profound fractures, and the formations on one side of these have
    settled down and on the other side have been pushed up (faulted), so as
    to expose parts that were once much below the surface. Sometimes also
    the crust has been folded and crumpled, and the wrinkles thus formed
    have afterwards been worn away or cut open by deep valleys, and rocks
    that were once deeply buried have been laid bare. By the revelations
    made in these and other ways, it has been learned that at various times
    in the history of the earth molten matter has been thrust into fissures
    or intruded between layers of the crust and cooled there, without
    coming to the surface. Sometimes the lava appears to have forced its
    way into the rocks, and sometimes to have lifted the upper beds and
    formed great subterranean layers or tumor-like aggregates, called
    bathyliths and laccoliths (<a href="#fig334"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 334</a>). Such intruded bodies of molten
    rock, solidifying under the varying conditions of such subterranean
    situations, are a fruitful source of instruction respecting the
    influence of varying rates and modes of cooling, as well as of other
    attendant conditions.</p>

    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 334.—Diagram of a laccolith. (Gilbert.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It will thus be readily seen that the rate of cooling of the various
    molten rocks must have differed very greatly. In the portions
    poured out upon the surface there were sometimes narrow streams and
    thin sheets, giving large exposure in proportion to the mass (<a href="#fig335"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    335</a>), and sometimes thick flows and deep pondings in basins and
    choked valleys, giving massive bodies with relatively small surface
    exposure. There were explosions of the lava into minute particles
    with almost instantaneous cooling, and there were eruptions beneath
    the sea the peculiar effects of which are rather matters of inference
    than of positive knowledge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span> In the portions underground there were
    insinuations into thin fissures, on the one hand, and in-thrustings of
    thick bodies, on the other. Some intrusions entered the upper part of
    the crust where the rocks were cold and wet, and some were thrust into
    the deeper portions where the rocks were warmer and less penetrated
    by water. Sometimes the lava rose rapidly and was little cooled in
    passage, sometimes slowly with more cooling en route, and sometimes
    there were long halts between eruptions, with much opportunity to cool.
    An almost infinite variety of conditions is thus presented, and with it
    a rich field for the study of the modes of solidification.</p>

    exposure. Holemaumau, Hawaii. (Libbey.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>In the underground intrusions the additional factor of high pressure
    was also present, and this is the third important condition in
    determining the nature of igneous rocks.</p>

  <p>The three factors, <i>composition</i>, <i>rate of cooling</i>, and
    <i>degree of pressure</i>, require special consideration.</p>

  <h4><i>Composition of Igneous Rocks.</i></h4>

  <p>All or nearly all the chemical elements known on the earth are found
    in greater or less amounts in igneous rocks, and in a broad sense are
    constituents of them. If there are any exceptions, they are most likely
    to be found in the rarer elements in the atmosphere. Oxygen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span> nitrogen,
    hydrogen, aqueous vapor, and carbonic acid, which make up the mass of
    the present atmosphere, are all found in lavas and in their cooled
    products. Probably all the rarer elements also occur in igneous rocks.
    Helium is known to be given forth by springs.</p>

  <p><b>Leading elements.—</b>But although nearly or quite all the known
    chemical elements enter into the igneous rocks, only a few of them are
    abundant. These are regarded as normal or essential constituents, while
    the rarer substances are regarded as incidental. By combining a large
    number of the most trustworthy analyses of rocks of all sorts, F. W.
    Clarke<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> has estimated the relative amounts of the more abundant
    elements in the crust of the earth with the following result:</p>

  <p>It will be seen that only eight of the elements hold a high rank
    in quantity. Many that are of the utmost importance in the history
    of the earth and the affairs of men are low in the list, or do not
    even appear in it at all, because their quantity is too small to be
    estimated in percentages. The precious metals, and even some of the
    more common metals, as lead, zinc, and copper, are too scarce to form
    an appreciable percentage.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span></p>

  <p><b>Union of elements.—</b>In a general study of the igneous rocks we
    may for the present neglect all but the first eight of these elements.
    Out of these elements spring various chemical combinations, and out
    of these combinations spring the various minerals, and out of the
    combinations of minerals come the various rocks. The union of oxygen
    with the other seven elements may be taken as a fundamental step in
    this series of combinations. The result is the following oxides:
    Silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), ferrous, ferric, and magnetic
    oxide (FeO, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), magnesia (MgO), calcium
    oxide or lime (CaO), soda (Na<sub>2</sub>O), and potash (K<sub>2</sub>O). The oxygen
    sometimes unites in proportions different from those here given, but
    such exceptions may be neglected in a general study. We thus have nine
    leading oxides. Of these, silica acts as an acid, or more strictly
    according to the newer chemical view, as an acid anhydride. All the
    rest, except the magnetic oxide of iron, and sometimes the oxide of
    aluminum, act as basic oxides.</p>

  <p>In the older chemical philosophy these oxides were supposed to combine
    by the simple union of an acid oxide with a basic oxide, and to remain
    as oxide joined to oxide; thus silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and lime (CaO) formed
    silicate of lime (CaO,Si<sub>2</sub>). The symbols express the idea better than
    the words. This method is used in the older geological works and in
    some of the later. But in the newer chemical doctrine, the oxides are
    not believed to remain so distinct after their union, and the symbols
    are written CaSiO<sub>3</sub>, and the compound is named calcium silicate.
    According to the modern doctrine of solution, some of the calcium,
    silicon, and oxygen may exist as free ions in molten rock. The precise
    way in which the elements are related to each other in these compounds
    can scarcely be said to be known. For the general purposes of geology
    it is most convenient to think of these oxides as uniting in the
    simple fashion first named, and this involves no apparent geological
    error in general studies, since they are oxides when they enter the
    compound, and if the compound is decomposed they usually come forth
    again as oxides; but in closer studies more complex unions, attended by
    dissociations (ionization), must be recognized.</p>

  <p><b>Formation of minerals.—</b>As but one of the leading oxides that
    abound in an average magma plays the part of an acid, the silica, a
    very simple conception of the general nature of igneous rocks may be
    reached by noting that they are mostly silicates of the seven leading
    basic oxides—alumina, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, and the iron
    oxides. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span> general idea is a very useful one and represents a most
    important truth; but in its use we must not forget that there are many
    exceptions. Sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, and other elements unite
    with the bases to form sulphates, sulphides, phosphates, phosphides,
    chlorides, etc. So also there are many minor bases that form silicates;
    and these minor bases unite with the minor acids to form many more or
    less rare minerals. Again, there are native metals in some igneous
    rocks. But altogether these hardly reach more than one or two percent.
    of the whole.</p>

  <p>There are, however, two exceptions of more importance. In the molten
    magma the acid and basic elements are not always evenly matched. When
    there is an excess of silica, a portion remains free and takes the
    form of quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>). If there is an excess of the basic oxides,
    the weakest one is usually left out of the combination. This is
    commonly the iron oxide, which then usually takes the form of magnetite
    (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). It is a singular fact that quartz often forms when there
    is no excess of silica, and magnetite when there is no excess of base.
    Quartz (free acid anhydride) and magnetite (free basic oxide) sometimes
    occur in the same rock. The explanation for this is yet to be found.
    These form rather important exceptions to the generalization that the
    igneous rocks are mostly made up of silicates, but, thus qualified,
    it expresses the essential truth, and has the merit of embodying the
    central chemical fact relative to these rocks.</p>

  <p><b>Sources of complexity.—</b>But here simplicity ends. As we pass
    on to the specific silicates that are formed, we encounter several
    sources of complexity. In the first place, the silica unites with
    the bases in different ratios and thus gives rise to unisilicates or
    orthosilicates (ratio of oxygen of bases to oxygen of silica, 1:1),
    subsilicates (ratio more than 1), bisilicates (ratio 1:2), trisilicates
    or polysilicates (ratio 1:3 or higher), and combinations of these.
    All the bases are not known to combine in all these ways, but many do
    in more than one of them. Still, if the silica were content to unite
    with each of the bases by itself alone, the results would remain
    comparatively simple; but instead of this it unites with two or more
    at the same time; and, more than that, it unites with them in varying
    amounts. The case would still remain measurably simple if these
    chemical compounds always crystallized out by themselves, each compound
    forming one mineral, and but one; but the different silicates have
    the confusing habit of crystallizing together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span> in the same mineral. A
    crystal may thus sometimes be seen, under the microscope, to be made up
    of alternating layers of different silicates; e.g., a microscopic layer
    of an aluminum-calcium silicate may be overlain by a microscopic layer
    of an aluminum-sodium silicate, and the alternation may be repeated
    throughout the crystal, giving it a banded structure. There is reason
    to believe that this is true in many cases where the microscope fails
    to detect it, and that less symmetrical comminglings of silicates may
    take place. As such alternations or mixtures are not governed by any
    known mathematical law, as is the case in chemical compounds, there is
    no determinate limit to the number of combinations that may arise. As
    a matter of fact, new ones are still being discovered in the progress
    of research, and the total number that may ultimately be found can
    scarcely be prophesied.</p>

  <p>As a result of all this fertility of combination, the total number of
    silicious minerals in igneous rocks is large. It is the function of the
    mineralogist to treat of these minerals as such. The geologist deals
    with them as constituents of the earth and as factors in its history.
    Only a few of them are so abundant as to require special individual
    notice in a general study of the earth. It may be remarked also that
    only a few of them can be identified by simple inspection as they
    occur in the rocks, partly because of the delicacy of the distinctions
    between many of them, and partly because of their minuteness and
    intricate intermixture. The resources of the polarizing microscope
    are necessary for safe determination in most cases. The student need
    not feel embarrassment or discouragement if he is often unable to
    recognize the constituents of the intimately crystalline rocks. Their
    determination has grown to be a profession by itself.</p>

  <p><b>The leading minerals of igneous rocks.—</b>Fortunately for the
    simplicity of geological study, a few minerals make up the great mass
    of the igneous rocks. These few are <i>quartz</i>, the <i>feldspathic
    minerals</i>, the <i>ferromagnesian minerals</i>, and the <i>iron
    oxides</i>. Quartz (silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>) is the free acid already
    mentioned. The feldspathic and ferromagnesian minerals are the leading
    silicates of the earth’s crust, and vastly surpass all others in
    abundance. The feldspathic group embraces minerals formed by silica in
    union with alumina, together with either potash, soda, or lime, or two
    or more of these together. The ferromagnesian group embraces minerals
    formed by the union of silica with iron, magnesia, and lime, together
    with more or less of the other basic oxides.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span> These statements are only
    true in a very general sense. Admixtures, replacements, and impurities
    are so frequent as to break down all sharp, simple definitions. The
    feldspathic minerals are normally light in color, ranging from white to
    red or gray. The ferromagnesian minerals are normally dark (commonly
    greenish) from the presence of iron, the great coloring element of
    rocks. But these color distinctions do not hold good in detail and
    cannot be much trusted as a means of identification.</p>

  <p><b>The feldspathic minerals</b> (<a href="#Page_462"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 462</a>) embrace the potash
    feldspars, <i>orthoclase</i> and <i>microcline</i>; the soda
    feldspar, <i>albite</i>; the lime feldspar, <i>anorthite</i>; and
    the mixed feldspars intermediate between albite and anorthite, viz.,
    the soda-lime feldspar, <i>oligoclase</i>, the lime-soda feldspar,
    <i>andesine</i>, in which lime and soda are nearly equal, and the
    lime-soda feldspar, <i>labradorite</i>, in which the lime predominates;
    together with <i>leucite</i>, a potash silicate higher in alkali
    than orthoclase, and <i>nephelite</i>, a soda silicate higher in
    soda than albite. Leucite and nephelite are usually classified as
    <i>feldspathoids</i>, not as feldspars. It is to be understood that
    alumina is normally present in all these. Additional details respecting
    these minerals may be found in the reference list, <a href="#Page_460"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 460</a>.</p>

  <p>Among the <b>ferromagnesian minerals</b> the most important are the
    pyroxenes, the amphiboles, and the biotite type of mica. Olivine is
    of subordinate importance. The pyroxenes (<a href="#Page_465"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 465</a>) and amphiboles
    (<a href="#Page_460"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 460</a>) have nearly the same chemical composition, but differ in
    crystallization and physical properties. <i>Hornblende</i> (an
    amphibole) has been melted, and on cooling under proper conditions
    found to take on the form of <i>augite</i> (a pyroxene). Pyroxene is
    sometimes altered into <i>uralite</i>, one of the amphiboles. The
    pyroxenes and amphiboles are the most abundant of the dark minerals
    in crystalline rocks. The leading members of the pyroxene group are
    <i>augite</i>, <i>diallage</i>, <i>hypersthene</i>, <i>enstatite</i>,
    and <i>soda pyroxene</i>. The chief members of the amphibole group are
    <i>hornblende</i> and the <i>soda amphiboles</i>. All are essentially
    silicates of magnesia and iron oxide, with or without the addition of
    lime, soda, and alumina. Details respecting these may be found in the
    reference list.</p>

  <p>The two leading <b>micas</b> are the iron-magnesia mica,
    <i>biotite</i>, and the potash mica, <i>muscovite</i>, the familiar
    “isinglass” of the stove-door. Chemically, muscovite should go with the
    potash feldspars, but it is distinguished from them by its crystalline
    habit and physical properties. The biotite should go chemically with
    the pyroxenes and amphiboles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span> which it closely resembles except in its
    crystalline properties. Details respecting the micas may be found in
    the reference list, <a href="#Page_464"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 464</a>.</p>

  <p>Two <b>iron oxides</b>, magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and hematite
    (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) are widely disseminated in igneous rocks. They constitute
    the free bases already mentioned.</p>

  <p><b>Summary of salient facts.—</b>The salient facts are, therefore, (1)
    that out of the seventy-odd chemical elements in the earth, eight form
    the chief part of it; (2) that one of these elements uniting with the
    rest forms nine leading oxides; (3) that one of these oxides acts as
    an acid and the rest as bases; (4) that by their combination they form
    a series of silicates of which a few are easily chief; (5) that these
    silicates crystallize into a multitude of minerals of which again a few
    are chief; and (6) that these minerals are aggregated in various ways
    to form rocks. Possessed of these leading ideas, we are prepared to
    turn to the consideration of some of the conditions under which these
    combinations take place in the formation of rocks from molten magmas.</p>

  <h3>THE NATURE OF MOLTEN MAGMAS.</h3>

  <p>We easily fall into the habit of thinking of molten rock as we think
    of a molten metal, merely as a substance which has passed from the
    solid to the liquid condition because of high temperature. With the
    return of low temperature a molten metal returns to the solid state
    usually in the same molecular condition which it possessed before.
    The point of fusion and the point of solidification are the same and
    are rigidly fixed. If this were true of the constituents of a rock, a
    definite order for the solidification of the several minerals might
    be anticipated. As a matter of fact, the order is not the same under
    all conditions, and, what is especially significant, the order is
    far from being that in which the constituents would fuse or would
    solidify separately. For instance, in a granite composed chiefly of
    quartz, feldspar, and mica, the quartz is often the last to take
    form, although it is more infusible than the feldspar or the mica.
    This and other phenomena show that a molten magma is not to be viewed
    simply as a fused substance, but rather as a <i>solution</i> of one
    silicate in another, or as a solution of several silicates in one
    another mutually. The high temperature is to be regarded merely as a
    condition prerequisite to solution, or as the condition of fusion of
    some one constituent which then dissolves the others. If crystals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span> of
    snow, sugar, and salt be mixed at a low temperature and compacted,
    the mass may be regarded as an artificial rock. On raising the
    temperature, all will pass into solution while the temperature is
    still somewhat below the melting-point of the snow, the most fusible,
    and while it is much below that of either the sugar or the salt. This
    particular case is instructive because the ice is not simply fused by
    temperature; the affinity of the salt plays a part. If the temperature
    were again lowered, the sugar and salt would not crystallize out at
    their fusing-points, but would remain in solution down to and even
    below the normal freezing-point of water; in other words, they would
    remain in solution until the water crystallized out and forced them
    to take the solid state. This holds good when the amounts of the
    sugar and salt are small relative to the water. If, on the contrary,
    their quantity is large relatively, crystallization will take place
    at higher temperatures and before the water crystallizes to ice. From
    this it appears that the salt and sugar might crystallize either before
    the water or after it, according to the degree of concentration. The
    behavior of mixtures of minerals in passing into and out of the molten
    condition appears to be quite analogous to this, and hence a great
    variety of results attend the process, dependent upon the number, the
    nature, and the relative quantities of the ingredients. The approved
    conception of the genesis of a rock from a molten magma (when ample
    time is given) is that one compound after another crystallizes out as
    the temperature falls and its point of <i>saturation</i> for each is
    reached, until the whole has been solidified. The modes of combination
    of the elements in the molten magma are not necessarily the same as
    those in the derivative crystals; indeed, the combinations doubtless
    change as the process proceeds; certain constituents being taken out,
    the remaining ones probably rearrange themselves.</p>

  <p><b>Time required in crystallization.—</b>The liquid magma of igneous
    rocks is essentially a fluid glass or slag. It is analogous to common
    glass, which is a silicate of potash, soda, or other base, except that
    usually common glass is relatively free from iron and other coloring
    substances, while these abound in the natural magmas and render them
    dark and more or less opaque; but the fundamental nature is the
    same, except that the natural lavas are usually mixtures of several
    silicates, while the artificial glasses consist of only one, or at most
    a few. Furnace slag is essentially an artificial lava.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span></p>

  <p>When a lava is cooled quickly, the commingled silicates solidify in the
    diffused condition essentially as they were in the liquid; for there
    is no time for the silicate molecules of a like kind to come together,
    particle by particle, in regular systematic order, as required in
    crystallization. The essential feature of crystallization is this
    systematic arrangement of the molecules according to a definite plan,
    giving a specific crystal form, as a cube, a hexagonal prism, etc.</p>

  <p>There are six (sometimes made seven) fundamental systems of
    crystallization, and a multitude of variations of special form in each
    system. The treatment of these forms belongs to mineralogy.</p>

  <p>In a thick viscid liquid, this systematic arrangement of molecules
    into definite crystal forms takes place slowly, for the crystalline
    force in the silicates is far less energetic than that in water,
    which crystallizes into ice with much rapidity and with great force.
    Because of this slowness, the solidification of the lava may catch
    the process of crystallization at any stage. If the lava is cooled
    quickly, the result is a glass; if less quickly, part glass and part
    crystals; if slowly enough, all becomes crystalline. In general the
    slower the growth the larger the crystals. The solidification product
    may, therefore, range from a glass to a mass of crystals; i.e., it may
    be (1) wholly glass, (2) a glassy matrix with a few small crystals
    scattered through it, (3) a less abundant glassy matrix with more and
    larger crystals, (4) a mere remnant of glass in a mass of crystals, or
    (5) a mass of crystals with no glass.</p>

  <p><b>Successive stages of crystallization.—</b>Since eruptions take
    place intermittently, it is obvious that cooling of the lava may be in
    progress in its hidden reservoir during the quiescent intervals between
    eruptions. After a certain stage of partial crystallization has been
    reached during such time of quiet, a renewal of eruption may take place
    and the whole mass of lava be shifted into quite new conditions, and
    a second phase of solidification may be superposed on the one already
    started. The rock will then show two phases of crystallization: (1)
    large crystals of the kind or kinds most prone to develop in the given
    lava may have grown during the first long stage of slow subterranean
    cooling, while the greater part of the lava still remained liquid; and
    (2) small crystals or glass may have developed when the more rapid
    cooling under the new conditions took place. The result would be large
    crystals set in a matrix of small crystals or of glass, a combination
    styled <i>porphyritic</i>. In such cases the lava, in its later stages,
    carries the large crystals floating throughout its mass, and is not a
    simple liquid.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

  <h3>THE FRAGMENTAL PRODUCTS OF SUDDEN COOLING.</h3>

  <p><b>Pyroclastic rocks.—</b>The extreme example of sudden cooling is
    presented when lavas are violently exploded into the air and solidify
    almost instantly. The resulting glassy particles or filaments, if
    small, constitute <i>volcanic ash</i>. The explosion appears to be
    due to steam and other gases which are held in the deeper lava under
    great pressure, but which, as they rise toward the surface of the
    lava where the pressure is relieved, expand with explosive violence.
    It is probably also due in part to progressive crystallization, which
    forces the gases out from the part that crystallizes and overcharges
    the rest. Sometimes the projected particles draw after themselves long
    <i>filaments</i> like the threads of spun glass, and sometimes while
    in the air they divide and draw apart, spinning a filament of viscid
    lava between them. A variety of this kind at the volcano of Kilauea in
    Hawaii is known as “Pele’s hair.” These light filaments drift with the
    wind and lodge on the lee side of the volcano, covering the surface
    “like mown grass” (Dana).</p>

    size. (Photo. by Church.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>When the exploded fragments are coarser they fall about the volcanic
    vent and form the <i>tuffs</i> (<i>tufa</i>) of which most steep
    volcanic cones are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span> chiefly built. In these larger fragments, crystals
    are not infrequently found, and the same is even true of the volcanic
    ash. These crystals are undoubtedly such as had already been formed in
    the lava before it exploded, and their formation, as suggested above,
    may have contributed to the explosion.</p>

  <p>Fragments too large to be borne far away by the air, but still small,
    are known as <i>lapilli</i>, especially if they are somewhat rounded
    and gravel-like. A finer variety, of the nature of sand, much used in
    making Portland cement, is locally known as <i>puzzolana</i>.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig337">
    <img class="illowp95" src="images/fig337.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 337.—Volcanic bomb of unusual form, 13

  </figure>

  <p>The rougher, irregular fragments of a clinker-like nature ejected by
    volcanoes are known as <i>scoriæ</i> or <i>cinders</i>. They are more
    or less distended by gas-bubbles and are hence light and pumiceous.</p>

  <p>The larger masses of lava ejected into the air are often caused to
    rotate by the unequal force of the projection, or by the unequal
    friction of the air, and to assume spheroidal forms, the internal gases
    at the same time often expanding and rendering the mass vesicular.
    These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span> rounded projectiles are known as <i>volcanic bombs</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>
    <a href="#fig336">336</a> and <a href="#fig337">337</a>). Balls of lava that have originated in rolling movements
    of the seething mass, or in other ways, are also styled bombs. Usage is
    not altogether harmonious or consistent in the application of the term.</p>

  <p>The larger masses that are projected into the air are more or less
    vesicular from the expansion of included gases, as already noted, and
    so the fragmental products of volcanic action grade into the vesicular.
    The type of this class is <i>pumice</i>, in which the gas cavities
    make up by far the larger part of the volume of the whole mass, and
    the whole is reduced to the condition of a solidified froth or foam.
    So thin are the dividing films of glassy material in some cases that
    the whole is pure white, though the same material in solid mass would
    be dark. This solidified glassy froth is often lighter than water and
    floats freely on the sea until it becomes “water-logged” and sinks.
    Dredgings of the deep sea show that much pumice has accumulated there,
    and being far from the land has escaped burial by the sediments borne
    in by the rivers.</p>

  <p>All of these fragmental rocks produced by volcanic action are known
    as <i>pyroclastic</i> (fire-fragmented) rocks, a general term of much
    convenience in distinguishing them from lava-flows, on the one hand,
    and from the fragmental rocks produced by air and water (ordinary
    clastics), on the other.</p>

  <h3>THE GLASSY ROCKS.</h3>

  <p><b>The solid glasses.—</b>The quick cooling of lava-flows into solid
    glasses is chiefly dependent on their exposure at the surface. Hence it
    is often the case that the exterior of a lava-flow is glassy in greater
    or lesser degree, while the interior is more or less crystalline.
    Quick cooling is sometimes also due to the intrusion of the lava in
    thin sheets into fissures in cold rocks. When massive bodies of lavas
    penetrate solid rocks, the lava does not usually cool so fast as to
    prevent some degree of crystallization, and the crystallization may
    even become complete; but if the intruded lava sheet be very thin,
    the lava is liable to be cooled to a nearly perfect glass. The glassy
    condition is, therefore, subject to indefinite gradations. As a rule,
    the acid lavas are stiffer at the same temperature than the basic ones,
    and crystallize more slowly, so that acid glasses are more common than
    basic ones. The basic rocks usually crystallize pretty thoroughly,
    except on the immediate surface of the flows.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span></p>

  <p><b>The first stages of crystallization.—</b>The microscopic study of
    the volcanic glasses reveals great numbers of minute forms known as
    <i>crystallites</i>, <i>microlites</i>, <i>globulites</i>, etc., that
    appear to be first steps in crystallization, though many of them do
    not take definite geometrical shapes and some do not show the optical
    characters of crystals. There are minute globules (globulites),
    needles, and hair-like bodies (trichites) of more or less indeterminate
    nature, together with other forms that can be seen to be certainly the
    initial forms of well-known minerals.</p>

    natural size. (Photo. by Church.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The obsidians.—</b>Of the compact glassy rocks, <i>obsidian</i> is
    the best type. It is essentially a natural glass, formed usually of
    acid silicates. It has the close texture, conchoidal fracture, and
    other qualities of glass. It is usually black, but sometimes red,
    brown, purple, bluish, or gray. While chiefly of glass, it usually
    contains more or less of the incipient crystals above described,
    showing that even here the first step in the gradation to the next
    or the crystalline stage has been taken. These incipient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span> crystals
    sometimes become so abundant as to change the texture from the vitreous
    to the stony order. In some cases, the stony texture seems to have
    been developed in the obsidian after it was formed, the change being
    a part of a subsequent process of devitrification, but in other cases
    the crystals seem to be original. Besides these, there are often small
    globular bodies known as spherulites.</p>

  <p>Varieties of glassy rock in which the embryo crystals are more numerous
    and the glassy texture less perfect, are known as <i>pitchstones</i>.
    The fresh surfaces of these have rather the aspect of pitch or resin
    than that of true glass; hence their name. Like the obsidians, they
    are usually dark, but they take on greenish, brownish, yellowish, and
    light-colored hues as well. Sometimes glassy rock fractures in small
    spheroidal forms like pearls, and is known as <i>perlite</i>. Basic
    glasses are relatively rare, and while usually included under the term
    obsidian, are sometimes given special names.</p>

  <h3>SPECIAL STRUCTURES.</h3>

  <p><b>Flow structure.—</b>Lavas that cool into glassy rocks frequently
    contain gas cavities, colored spots and variations of texture which,
    together with the hair-like embryo crystals, are drawn out into lines,
    streaks, and parallel belts by the flow of the viscous mass, giving
    rise to <i>rhyolitic</i> or flow structure (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig338">338</a> and <a href="#fig339">339</a>). Rocks
    in which this is the most pronounced feature were formerly known as
    rhyolites, though the term has drifted away from this original meaning
    and has been applied to a class of acidic rocks. The obsidians and
    pitchstones may be more or less rhyolitic under the microscope, though
    to the naked eye they may appear only as a glassy or resinous mass.
    The rhyolites generally have but an imperfect glassy texture, since
    the crystals and the cavities sometimes make up a notable part of the
    mass, the glassy portion being scarcely more than a matrix in which
    the crystals, spherulites, and cavities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span> are carried. By an increase
    of the crystals in number and size, the rock passes by gradations into
    porphyry or phanerite.</p>

  <p><b>Amygdaloids.—</b>In lava-flows the included steam often collects
    in bubbles near the surface as the lava cools and forms a vesicular
    portion with a scoriaceous texture (<a href="#fig341"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 341</a>). In its upper part,
    the vapor bubbles may be numerous, while below they become more and
    more scattered until they disappear. Similar bubbles are also often
    found near the bottom of a sheet of lava. This is perhaps due to the
    rolling under of the frontal surface of the lava-stream as it flows.
    Later, these cavities often become filled with minerals deposited from
    solution and the rock then becomes an amygdaloid, but this filling is a
    secondary action.</p>

  <h3>THE PORPHYRITIC ROCKS.</h3>

  <p>When the conditions are such that after a part of the magma has formed
    distinct crystals floating in the remaining liquid lava, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span> is a
    change which causes the rest to solidify as a glass or as a mass of
    small crystals, the structure is known as <i>porphyritic</i>, and the
    rocks possessing it are called <i>porphyries</i>. This differentiation
    into distinct crystals set in a ground-mass of minute crystals or
    of glass often gives a mottled or variegated aspect to the rock,
    especially if the matrix of glass or minute crystals differs in color
    from the distinct crystals. This structure is much oftener developed
    in acidic rocks than in basic ones, because the latter crystallize
    more readily. The most common porphyritic crystals are feldspar
    and quartz, though they are by no means the only ones. The matrix
    is also usually felsitic or quartzose, but not necessarily so. The
    character is a structural one, and is not dependent upon any special
    chemical or mineralogical constitution. The distinct crystals are
    known as phenocrysts, and the varieties of porphyries are named from
    the characteristic phenocryst, e.g., quartzophyre (quartz-porphyry)
    if the conspicuous crystals are quartz, orthophyre if orthoclase,
    augitophyre if augite, etc. A convenient classification has recently
    been proposed<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> into (1) <i>leucophyre</i> (white porphyries), which
    have a light-colored ground-mass set with phenocrysts of any kind, and
    (2) <i>melaphyres</i> (black porphyries), which have a dark-colored
    ground-mass, with phenocrysts of any kind. While it is to be hoped this
    usage will prevail, it is to be noted that these terms, especially the
    latter, have been used in a different sense. (See reference list of
    rocks, <a href="#Page_446"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 445</a>.)</p>

  <p>In many cases the ground-mass itself becomes minutely crystalline
    and the porphyritic aspect is due simply to large distinct crystals
    set in a mass of minute obscure ones. The rock is then really
    <i>holocrystalline</i>, but the term porphyry is applied to it. In
    other rocks the crystals of the ground-mass become more and more
    distinct, the porphyritic aspect gradually disappears, and there is a
    graduation into the next class.</p>

  <h3>THE PHANEROCRYSTALLINE ROCKS.</h3>

  <p><b>The phanerites.—</b>When time enough is given for the cooling
    process the molten magma becomes completely crystalline. The
    holocrystalline rocks hence include a large series, ranging from
    the most acid to the most basic. In this class the differentiation
    of the rock material and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>the formation of distinct minerals reach
    a high stage, and as a natural result the varieties of rock are
    numerous. Taken as a group they are phanerites. If they are to be more
    particularly characterized, it is usually done on the basis of the
    minerals of which they are composed. The following are the leading
    types, beginning with those which are rich in silica and poor in basic
    oxides, and ending with those which are rich in basic oxides and poor
    in silica.</p>

    size. (Photo. by Church.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>The granites.—</b>The term granite was originally used to designate
    a granular, i.e., a distinctly crystalline, rock, and it is still
    popularly and properly so used. In scientific treatises it has usually
    been confined to a special aggregate of crystals of quartz, feldspar,
    and mica. It has recently been proposed to give it again a more general
    application, though not quite its original one, by including under it
    all holocrystalline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span> rocks composed of dominant quartz and feldspar
    of any kind, with mica, hornblende, or other minerals in subordinate
    amount. In scientific literature as it now stands, granite consists of
    quartz, feldspar, and mica, the feldspar being of the alkali-potash
    or soda variety (orthoclase, microcline, or albite), and the mica,
    either muscovite or biotite. In the type form the crystals are distinct
    and sometimes large (<a href="#fig344"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 344</a>). They are intimately mingled with one
    another, and in growing, interfered more or less with each other and
    so became interlocked. The granites are among the most common and
    easily recognized of the holocrystalline rocks. Their color is mainly
    dependent upon the feldspar, the red and pink varieties of the mineral
    giving rise to red granite, and the white varieties to gray granite.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig345">
    <img class="illowp88" src="images/fig345.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 345.—Graphic granitic (or pegmatitic)
    texture. Nearly natural size. (Photo. by Church.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span></p>

  <p>Very few granites conform strictly to the type. They vary by the
    addition and substitution of other minerals, and these sometimes
    become as prominent as the type minerals. The soda-lime feldspars
    sometimes take the place of the orthoclase, or accompany it; hornblende
    and other minerals take the place of the biotite, or occur with it;
    and so on. Whenever one of these replacing or accessory minerals is
    notable in quantity, its name is often prefixed, as hornblende-granite,
    oligoclase-granite, zircon-granite, etc. In this way the rock grades
    almost insensibly into the syenites, diorites, etc. Variations also
    arise from the absence of one of the three leading minerals. If mica
    is absent, the rock is termed an <i>aplite</i> (quartz and feldspar).
    If the feldspar is absent, it is called a <i>greisen</i> (quartz and
    mica). If quartz is absent, it is termed a <i>minette</i> (feldspar
    and mica). These varietal terms are neither universally nor always
    consistently used, and it is to be hoped they will be replaced by the
    systematic nomenclature recently proposed and outlined later (<a href="#Page_451"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 451</a>).</p>

  <p>The granites were formed from a magma rich in silica, alumina, potash,
    and soda, but generally poor in lime, iron, and magnesia. Incidentally
    other substances were present. The alumina, potash, and other bases
    united with so much of the silica as was required to form the feldspars
    and micas, and the remaining silica crystallized into quartz.</p>

  <p>Granite is normally a massive rock without foliation or banding. If it
    takes on these characters, it becomes a <i>gneiss</i>, and passes into
    the foliated or schistose class of rocks, to be discussed later. The
    texture of graphic granite (see pegmatite) is notably peculiar, due to
    the simultaneous crystallization of the quartz and feldspar (<a href="#fig345"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 345</a>).</p>

  <p><b>The syenites.—</b>When the mica of a granite is replaced
    by hornblende, the rock is now commonly known as a
    <i>hornblende-granite</i>, but it was formerly called <i>syenite</i>,
    because found at Syene on the Nile. The term syenite is now applied to
    a rock consisting essentially of feldspar and hornblende or mica, but
    there is a complete gradation from the granites to the syenites. The
    magma of the syenites was richer in iron and magnesium than the typical
    granitic magma. The syenites also grade into other classes, as do the
    granites, and are named by similar prefixes, as augite-syenite, etc.,
    and some of these varieties have special names. The syenites are red or
    gray, according to the color of the feldspar, and are usually darker
    than the granites. The texture of syenite is like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span> that of granite. In
    the scheme of field names recently proposed, syenite is made to include
    all holocrystalline rocks composed mainly of feldspar of any kind, with
    subordinate amounts of mica, hornblende, pyroxene, and other minerals,
    but without a noticeable amount of quartz.</p>

  <p><b>The diorites.—</b>These embrace rocks which were crystallized from a
    magma still poorer in silica and the alkalies, and richer in the earthy
    bases. In composition they closely approach the ideal average rock,
    but usually fall a little below it in silica and the alkalies, and
    rise a little above it in the earthy bases. In current usage, diorite
    is defined as an intimate mixture of crystals of hornblende and a
    plagioclase feldspar. It differs from the syenite in having plagioclase
    feldspar instead of orthoclase. By substitutions and the addition of
    accessory minerals, the diorites graduate toward the granites and
    syenites on the one hand, as already noted, and into gabbros on the
    other.</p>

  <p>In the scheme recently proposed, all holocrystalline rocks in which
    hornblende is dominant and feldspar subordinate are classed as diorites.</p>

  <p><b>The gabbros.—</b>The name gabbro was formerly applied to a
    coarse-grained basic rock consisting of labradorite and diallage, but
    the name has been gradually extended until it embraces a large group
    of rocks that have essentially the same composition as the dolerites
    mentioned below, but are coarser in crystallization, and the crystals
    do not embrace one another (i.e., are not ophitic). The principal
    minerals are plagioclase (normally labradorite) and pyroxene (normally
    diallage) with magnetite or ilmenite. They are usually dark, heavy
    rocks. The pearly luster of the cleavage faces of the diallage, when
    present, gives a peculiar sheen to a fresh surface of the rock. In
    the recently proposed field names, gabbro is made to include all
    phanerocrystalline rocks in which pyroxene predominates, attended
    by feldspar of any kind in subordinate quantity, with or without
    hornblende or mica.</p>

  <p><b>The peridotites.—</b>These stand at the basic end of the series,
    having been formed from a magma in which the silica was low (39–45 per
    cent.), as were also the alumina, lime, and alkalies, but in which the
    magnesia was relatively very high, ranging from 35 to 48 per cent.
    The rock consists very largely of olivine associated with pyroxene,
    magnetite, and other very basic minerals. Little or no feldspar is
    present. The peridotites are much less abundant than the preceding
    classes and represent a very distinctive phase of the magma in which
    the magnesia was greatly concentrated.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span></p>

  <p>Closely allied to the peridotites are rocks which are made up largely
    of a single basic mineral, as <i>augitite</i>, <i>pyroxenite</i>,
    <i>hornblendite</i>, rocks essentially formed of the minerals augite,
    pyroxene, and hornblende respectively. It will be noted that in these
    rocks the magma became quite simple in nature, just as at the acid
    end of the series certain rocks become comparatively simple from the
    concentration of the acid element, as in certain acidic granites,
    felsites, etc. (See <a href="#Page_523"><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 523–524</a>.)</p>

  <p><b>The basalts.—</b>The term basalt is used in a somewhat comprehensive
    way to embrace dark, compact, igneous rocks that appear to be nearly
    homogeneous, owing to the minuteness of the crystals, which are
    usually so small as to be identifiable only under the microscope.
    In some cases the crystals are scattered throughout a ground-mass
    after the porphyritic fashion. In some of these cases there is a true
    glassy base, and in such cases the rock does not strictly belong in
    the holocrystalline group. In the more typical cases the constituent
    minerals are very minutely crystallized and intimately intermixed. The
    leading minerals are plagioclase (usually labradorite or anorthite)
    and pyroxene (usually augite), with olivine and magnetite or ilmenite
    usually present. There is a considerable range in chemical nature,
    but the basalts are relatively poor in silica, usually also low in
    potash and soda, but rich in lime, magnesia, and the iron oxides. They
    are classed as basic and are sometimes highly so. The magmas of the
    basalts are especially fluid, and when poured forth upon the surface
    easily spread out in thin sheets. In cooling they are prone to take on
    a columnar or basaltic structure, the columns standing at right angles
    to the surfaces exposed to cooling. The columns are sometimes curved,
    owing to the peculiar attitude of the cooling surface. The columns of
    Giant’s Causeway and Fingal’s Cave are familiar examples.</p>

  <p><b>The dolerites.—</b>The basalts graduate insensibly into the
    dolerites; indeed the dolerites may be regarded simply as basalts of
    coarser crystallization. The minerals are evident to the eye and range
    up to medium size. The more abundant minerals are plagioclase feldspar
    (labradorite or anorthite), with one or more of the ferromagnesian
    minerals (augite, olivine, or biotite), and magnetite or ilmenite. In
    the growth of the minerals one crystal frequently embraces others,
    giving an ophitic structure. The dolerites have many varieties, due
    either to accessory minerals or to the development of some of the
    constituents more amply than the rest. The type may be said to consist
    of plagioclase and augite, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span> other minerals being regarded as
    accessories. Magnetite or ilmenite is almost universally present. The
    varieties are usually designated by prefixes, as olivine-dolerite,
    enstatite-dolerite, etc., but special names are also used for some of
    these.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>The ancient dolerites have usually undergone internal changes and such
    rocks are often called <i>diabases</i>. While the use of the term has
    not been uniform, it accords with the better practice to regard the
    diabases simply as partially altered dolerites and basalts. In general,
    therefore, the diabases are but ancient dolerites.</p>

  <h4><i>General names.</i></h4>

  <p>The difficulty of distinguishing many of the foregoing rocks from each
    other by any means available in the field, owing to the minuteness
    of the crystals, and to the gradation of one type of rock into
    another, makes it desirable to employ certain general names which will
    correctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span> express the leading character of the rock without implying
    a knowledge of the precise mineral composition. A convenient term
    of this kind is <i>greenstone</i>, which merely indicates that the
    ferromagnesian minerals are prominent and usually give a greenish or
    dark cast to the rock. The greenstones embrace the diorites, dolerites,
    some of the gabbros and the basalts, and may even extend to the
    peridotites and some of the more hornblendic of the granitoid rocks.
    Another convenient name is <i>trap</i>, which may be used for any dark,
    heavy igneous rock. The name (from <i>trappe</i>, stairs) refers to
    the step-like arrangement which the edges of the superimposed sheets
    of lava often take, especially when the lava is of the free-flowing,
    basaltic kind.</p>

    formation. One mile south of Highgate Falls, Vt.</figcaption>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span></p>

  <p>The term basalt is sometimes used to embrace any of the very
    fine-grained dark igneous rocks. In such cases, it covers the very
    fine-grained dolerites, diorites, peridotites, etc. The term granite
    was used originally for any coarse-grained crystalline rock, and there
    is a tendency to revive this early use. In general descriptions, some
    of our best petrographers call any coarsely crystalline rock (e.g.,
    coarse-grained syenites, diorites, gabbros, etc.) granite. The term
    <i>granitoids</i> may be used with strict propriety to cover all rocks
    of this class.</p>

  <h3>DERIVATION OF SECONDARY ROCKS.</h3>

  <p>Rocks, though commonly made the symbol of the abiding, are subject
    to constant slow changes. Through these changes newer rocks have
    been derived from older ones, and still others in turn from these
    derivatives, and so on in an endless chain. All derived rocks are
    conveniently termed secondary, though they may be several generations
    removed from the primitive rocks, and even the primitive rocks, as we
    now understand them, may be themselves derived. The ordinary changes
    of rock are most active at or near the surface, and the processes
    of such change have already been discussed in part under the titles
    “Weathering” (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_54">54</a> and <a href="#Page_110">110</a>),

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span></p>

  <p><b>Regolith.—</b>The first great product of the surface changes is
    <i>mantle-rock</i> (<i>regolith</i>), which comprehends all the loose
    matter that springs from rock decay, wear, fracture, and other forms of
    disintegration. It lies in an unconsolidated sheet on the face of the
    land, whether as soil, sand, clay, earth, gravel, or loose rock.</p>

  <p><b>Disrupted products: arkose and wacke.—</b>In dry regions, in cold
    regions, on mountain heights and precipitous slopes, and under other
    conditions where sudden changes of temperature and frost action
    work efficiently, rocks are broken down into fine fragments without
    much chemical decomposition. Such <i>disaggregated</i> rather than
    decomposed matter, if derived from granitic and similar crystalline
    rocks, is termed <i>arkose</i>, or arkose sand, and consists of
    fragments of quartz, feldspar, mica, etc. Common sand consists
    essentially of quartz grains. If the fine fragments are derived from
    the darker igneous rocks, and consist mainly of grains of plagioclase
    feldspar, and ferromagnesian minerals, it is sometimes called
    <i>wacke</i>. This term is not widely used in just this sense, but
    there seems to be an important place for it, and it will be so employed
    in this work. These disaggregated sands are but special phases of the
    mantle-rock.</p>

  <p><b>Disintegrated products.—</b>When the surface-rock is chemically
    decomposed, the residual material is confined mainly to the insoluble
    portions, i.e., the silicious and clayey parts; while the lime,
    magnesia, soda, potash, and similar substances are largely dissolved
    and borne to the ocean. The potash is somewhat more disposed to remain
    with the clays than the soda, lime, or magnesia; but residues of all
    are usually present.</p>

  <h4><i>Classes of Sedimentary Rocks.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Shales, sandstones, and conglomerates.—</b>As already shown in the
    discussion of the atmosphere and surface-waters, the mantle-rock is
    constantly being borne away and redeposited in lodgment spots on the
    land or in the basins of the sea, while it is constantly being renewed
    below. It is an evanescent but ever-renewed derivative mantle. In this
    process of renewal, removal, and redeposition, the mantle material is
    usually assorted into mud, sand, and gravel; and these several classes
    of material are laid down more or less separately, and usually take
    the stratified form, because their deposition depends on different
    degrees of motion of the transporting waters or wind. When these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
    several classes of material become cemented or otherwise hardened,
    they give rise to <i>shales</i> (cemented muds), <i>sandstones</i>
    (cemented sands), and <i>conglomerates</i> (or pudding-stones, cemented
    gravel, <a href="#fig346"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 346</a>). If the coarse material remains angular, they form
    <i>breccia</i> instead of conglomerates (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig347">347</a> and <a href="#fig348">348</a>). For the
    most part, the deposits of mud, sand, and gravel are made under the
    sea or in lakes and estuaries, but they are also formed on the land
    in lodgment basins, in low-gradient valleys, and on base-plains. The
    deposits of sediment on land have received less recognition than they
    deserve. When formed under the sea or in other life-sustaining waters,
    shells and other organic material are liable to be entrapped and to
    form a part of the rock. These organic remains, or fossils, greatly
    aid in interpreting the deposits in which they occur. Fossils are less
    liable to be preserved in sedimentary deposits formed on land. There
    is, therefore, some ground to suspect that great series of sandstones
    and shales which do not contain marine or fresh-water fossils were
    formed in lodgment basins on land,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span> though the absence of fossils
    cannot be regarded as proof of such origin.</p>

  <p><b>Limestones and dolomites.—</b>Of the lime, magnesia, soda, and
    potash leached out of the surface-rocks and carried to the ocean in
    solution, the lime is largely extracted to form the shells, skeletons,
    teeth, armor, and other hard parts of sea-animals and sea-plants. These
    limy parts are at length left on the floor of the ocean and become more
    or less disintegrated and help to form beds of lime-mud and lime-sand
    which in time are cemented into <i>limestone</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig349">349</a>, <a href="#fig350">350</a>, <a href="#fig351">351</a>,
    and <a href="#fig352">352</a>). A larger proportion of the magnesia remains in solution
    in the sea-water, but in ways not yet well understood, the magnesia
    sometimes unites with the lime to form <i>dolomite</i>, a double
    carbonate of lime and magnesia (Ca,Mg)CO<sub>3</sub>. This change is sometimes
    local, and sometimes affects great series of beds, more commonly the
    ancient ones than the modern. Sometimes the dolomization appears to
    have taken place long after the original limestone was formed and
    probably sometimes after it was lifted out of the sea, while in other
    cases it seems to have taken place while the sediment was accumulating,
    or at least before the next overlying beds were laid down. The
    potash in solution is to some large extent taken up by the land- and
    sea-plants or is retained in the clays, and through them becomes again
    incorporated in the sediments. The soda largely remains in solution in
    the sea-water.</p>

  <p><b>Precipitates.—</b>When a portion of the ocean-water is isolated in
    a region where evaporation from the surface of the water is greater
    than the rainfall on it, and the inflow from the tributary basin,
    the lime, magnesia, soda, potash, and other dissolved substances
    (solutes) are concentrated until the water becomes saturated. The
    solutes are then precipitated in the order in which they reach the
    point of saturation. This order, when taken in strict and full detail,
    gives a very complex series, but the leading deposits are calcium
    carbonate (<i>limestone</i>), calcium sulphate (<i>gypsum</i>), and
    sodium chloride (<i>halite</i> or <i>rock salt</i>) (see <a href="#Page_375"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 375</a>).
    Isolated lakes in arid regions may give rise to similar deposits. It
    has sometimes been thought that the ancient limestones were produced
    largely by precipitation from concentrated sea-water. While this is
    probably the case in some instances and to some degree, it has not been
    demonstrated that the great limestone formations were made to any large
    extent in this way. The more accepted view is that the limestones in
    the main were made from organic remains. The lime in solution in the
    ocean is chiefly in the form of the sulphate.</p>

  <p><b>Iron Ore-beds.—</b>In a somewhat different way iron ore-deposits
    are formed by the precipitation of iron oxide or iron carbonate from
    solutions of ferrous compounds. The ferrous compounds in solution
    were leached from iron-bearing rocks by percolating waters. The most
    familiar case is that of iron-bearing springs. On exposure to the air,
    the iron compounds in solution undergo change, and ferric oxide is
    thrown down, usually forming <i>limonite</i> (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O),
    but sometimes <i>hematite</i> (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). This change is common in
    marshes and gives origin to “bog-ore.” Similar deposits take place in
    certain shallow lakes, and hence are known as “lake ore.” Iron ore
    sometimes also forms at the bottom of a peaty bed or in muddy soil.
    In connection with the great coal formations, beds of iron carbonate
    (<i>siderite</i>) occur. Organic matter seems to play a great part both
    in the original solution and the later deposition of these ores. From
    certain soils and clay-beds on which the ancient coal-producing forests
    grew, the iron has been almost completely removed, either by the action
    of the roots, or more probably by organic acids arising from their
    decay and from the decaying vegetation on the surface. On flowing into
    shallow bodies of water or into marshes, the waters containing such
    dissolved iron compounds usually throw down their iron content either
    as a carbonate (siderite), or as a hydrous ferric oxide (limonite).
    The siderite is formed where decaying vegetation is present to furnish
    abundant carbon dioxide and to partially protect the iron solution
    from oxidation, and the limonite where free oxidation takes place.
    Sand, silt, clay, or calcium carbonate often accumulates with the iron
    precipitate, and the result is an impure deposit which becomes an
    <i>ironstone</i>. Such deposits often become segregated into nodules,
    as will be explained later. It is thought that diatoms sometimes aid in
    the deposit of iron ore in shallow waters.</p>

  <p><b>Silicious deposits.—</b>In the decomposition of igneous rocks, a
    certain portion of the silica, as well as of the bases, is dissolved
    and carried away in solution. Certain organisms extract this from
    solution for their skeletons, just as others extract calcium carbonate.
    The accumulation of these silicious skeletons often forms silicious
    rocks. The <i>diatom</i>, <i>radiolarian</i>, and other oozes (<a href="#fig353"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    353</a>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span> of the deep sea are the great examples. Sometimes layers of
    infusorial earth, <i>tripolite</i>, arise from the shells of diatoms
    and other aquatic organisms secreting silica. The waters in which such
    earths accumulate are rather shallow, and either fresh or salt. The
    most familiar examples of indurated rocks formed in this general method
    are the <i>flints</i> and <i>cherts</i> (impure flints) that occur in
    limestone and chalk, chiefly as nodules, but sometimes in distinct beds.</p>

  <p><b>Organic rocks.—</b>While most limestones, chalks, flints, cherts,
    and the silicious and calcareous oozes are formed through the agency of
    organisms, they are not themselves strictly organic. There is, however,
    a small but important group of rocks formed directly from organic
    matter. In favorable situations the woody parts of plants, falling
    into water, are so far preserved from decay that they accumulate in
    beds, and by slow changes pass into <i>peat</i>, <i>lignite</i>,
    <i>bituminous coal</i>, <i>anthracite</i>, and <i>graphite</i>.
    The first of these is composed essentially of carbohydrates and
    hydrocarbons much as plants are, while the last two are mainly carbon,
    and the intermediate members represent stages of passage from the
    first to the last. They are all derived from the strictly organic
    part of the plants, and spring essentially from the atmosphere and
    hydrosphere. They are only indirectly associated with the evolutions of
    the inorganic series.</p>

  <h3>INTERNAL ALTERATIONS OF ROCKS.</h3>

  <p>Besides the extreme alterations of rocks at the surface of the earth
    by which they pass into solution and into residual mantle-rock, and
    at length by transportation and re-sedimentation become stratified
    rocks, as just described, those rocks which are not at the surface are
    subject to changes that give rise to several varieties of <i>altered
    rocks</i>. These changes are taking place constantly under ordinary
    conditions, though usually very slowly. Under great pressure and heat
    the changes are relatively rapid and intense, and lead to results not
    reached under other conditions. These more profound changes are termed
    <i>metamorphism</i>, and will be considered later. It is, however,
    important to recognize the great fact that the outer part of the earth,
    for perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 feet, is more or less fractured and
    permeated by water containing in solution various substances dissolved
    from the atmosphere, the soil, and the rocks through which it has
    already passed, and that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span> permeating and circulating water is
    now, and for long ages has been, working changes in the rocks, partly
    by dissolving matter out of them, partly by depositing matter in them,
    and partly by furnishing a medium through which new combinations of
    their constituents may take place. This outer fractured portion of the
    lithosphere has been called the <i>zone of fracture</i>.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

  <p><b>Oxidation and deoxidation.—</b>At and above the surface of
    the underground water, where the rocks are easily reached by
    atmospheric waters carrying much free oxygen, and by the air itself,
    <i>oxidation</i> prevails. Through oxidation the ferrous oxides are
    changed to ferric oxides, a change which is usually manifested by a
    transition from a gray, green, or blue color, to buff, brown, yellow,
    or red. The partial progress of such oxidation is often shown in a
    fractured block or bowlder whose exterior shows the latter colors,
    while the interior shows the former. The sulphides, of which common
    pyrites (FeS<sub>2</sub>) is the most familiar, are oxidized into sulphates,
    and then sometimes pass on into the higher oxides and other compounds.
    Thus copperas (FeSO<sub>4</sub>) arises from pyrites (FeS<sub>2</sub>) by direct
    oxidation of both Fe and S. The sulphuric acid of this compound,
    uniting with some base stronger than the ferrous oxide, gives rise to
    further oxidation and results in hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and limonite
    (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O). In general, the mineral constituents of the
    rocks in this upper zone take on their maximum states of oxidation.
    This oxidation affects more or less profoundly the character of the
    rock as a whole. Deeper in the earth oxidation is less prevalent, and
    the action is sometimes reversed and deoxidation takes place. So also
    wherever organic matter is undergoing decomposition deoxidation is
    likely to occur.</p>

  <p><b>Solution and deposition.—</b>Solution preponderates in the upper
    part of the zone of fracture, but deposition is prevalent in its deeper
    parts. The calcium carbonate and silica dissolved near the surface are
    often deposited below as calcite and quartz. The sulphates and other
    sulphur compounds that are formed and dissolved near the surface are
    apt to be changed into sulphides lower down by deoxidation. The soluble
    oxides and other compounds formed near the surface are often likewise
    precipitated below. This is particularly true where the descending
    waters encounter decomposing organic matter, and where they mingle
    with waters that have followed other routes and have become <span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>charged
    with different solutes. On coming together, reaction between the
    constituents takes place, resulting sometimes in new solutions and
    sometimes in precipitation.</p>

  <p>If these lower deposits of calcite, quartz, sulphides, etc., are made
    in the pores of the rock, they change its texture and composition.
    If they are made in fissures they constitute <i>veins</i>, and if a
    sufficient percentage of the vein matter consists of valuable metallic
    compounds, they constitute <i>ores</i>.</p>

  <p>As the waters descend they suffer greater and greater pressure and some
    increase of temperature, and these changes modify their power to hold
    substances in solution. In general, the waters increase in solvent
    power, but the effect is different for different mineral substances,
    and hence as a rule the waters are taking up some substances and
    laying down others as they proceed. After penetrating to greater or
    less depths, the waters may come again to the surface, either because
    they are pushed up by the higher head of the waters behind, or because
    they become warmer and thus lighter, and are forced up by the heavier
    cold waters above, or else they pass up by diffusion through the
    descending waters. In any case, the deep, warm waters, usually rather
    highly charged with material dissolved in their previous courses, are
    apt to deposit some of their burden as they ascend to horizons of
    lower pressures and temperatures. They are particularly liable to make
    deposits where they commingle with other waters differently charged
    with solutes. Thus internal changes in the body of the rocks are, and
    for ages have been, taking place. In the upper part of the depositing
    zone, calcite is the dominant mineral deposited, while in the lower,
    quartz is more common; but much depends on local conditions and other
    influences, and no rigid rule holds good.</p>

  <p><b>Hydration and dehydration.—</b>Water sometimes unites directly with
    some of the constituents of a rock and produces hydrated minerals,
    i.e., minerals that have water as an element of their constitution, not
    simply water absorbed into their pores. A large class of minerals known
    as zeolites, because they swell up and undergo life-like contortions
    when their basic water is driven off by heat, are examples of hydrous
    products. A more familiar example is limonite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O), of
    which yellow ocher is a variety, which on heating sufficiently gives
    off its water and becomes hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or red ocher. The
    turning of yellow clay to red brick on burning is a familiar example
    of dehydration. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span> general tendency in the upper zones penetrated
    by water is toward hydration. In the lower zones, where the pressure
    is great, Van Hise holds that there is a tendency toward dehydration,
    if the rocks have been previously hydrated. This may be the case if
    rocks have once been near the surface and later deeply buried by the
    accumulation of sediments on them. If the principle holds, rocks
    subjected to intense lateral pressure may be dehydrated.</p>

  <p><b>Carbonation and decarbonation.—</b>The igneous rocks are largely
    silicates. The carbonic acid of the surface-waters and of the air
    acting upon them, converts them, in part, into carbonates. In this
    way has arisen most of the original supply of calcium and magnesium
    carbonates. Original carbonates formed in this way are precipitated and
    redissolved again and again. The carbonates in river-waters are much
    more largely solutions of previously solid carbonates than original
    carbonates formed from the silicates. The potassium and sodium of the
    silicates also form carbonates, but by preference they unite with the
    sulphur and chlorine, and hence appear more largely as sulphates and
    chlorides.</p>

  <p>Carbonation is usually accompanied by oxidation and hydration. These
    several processes break up the complex and relatively unstable
    silicates into simpler and more stable silicates, carbonates, and
    oxides. This is illustrated by the following formulas illustrative
    of the changes undergone by augite and labradorite, two common
    rock-forming minerals.</p>

  <p>The composition of augite may be represented by the formula</p>

  <p>When waters charged with carbonates descend into the earth they are
    likely to precipitate a portion of their burden, forming calcite and
    other crystalline carbonates, and hence these are among the most
    common minerals found in veins and rock cavities. Carbonates are
    also deposited when carbonate-charged waters come to the surface and
    evaporate or lose a part of their carbon dioxide.</p>

  <p>Decarbonation also takes place, but it is, at least at the surface, a
    much less common process, and its conditions are less well understood.
    Sufficiently high heat will drive off the carbon dioxide, as in the
    artificial process of burning lime, but this is rarely observed in
    nature. Even lava intrusions do not usually reduce limestone to
    caustic lime at any appreciable distance from the contact. It is
    believed, however, that in the deeper zones, where high pressure and
    heat prevail, carbonates are changed into silicates, thus in a way
    reversing the process that prevails at the surface, and setting free
    again a portion of the carbon dioxide that had become locked up in the
    formation of the carbonates. To this action some of the carbon dioxide
    of deep-seated thermal springs is assigned.</p>

  <p>The carbonation of the silicates takes place at the expense of
    the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and hence
    in proportion as the igneous rocks are changed into carbonates,
    the atmosphere and hydrosphere are depleted of carbon dioxide, new
    supplies being neglected. As plants are dependent on carbon dioxide
    for their principal food, and as animals are dependent on plants for
    their food, directly or indirectly, the process of carbonation has
    a profound bearing on the life-history of the earth, and will often
    invite attention in the historical chapters. It is sufficient here to
    note that carbonation is one of the chief processes in the alteration
    of igneous rocks and furnishes, directly and indirectly, a larger
    percentage of the mineral substances dissolved in the waters that flow
    from the land, than any other single process.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span></p>

  <p><b>Molecular rearrangements.—</b>Besides these and similar changes that
    involve additions and subtractions through the agency of percolating
    water, the molecules of some of the rock constituents rearrange
    themselves, or the elements enter into new chemical relations; thus,
    pyroxene may pass into hornblende by a change of the crystalline
    arrangement of the molecules. The change may sometimes be caught in
    progress, the outer part of the crystal being hornblende (which when
    thus formed is called <i>uralite</i>), while the heart of the crystal
    remains pyroxene. So aragonite may pass into calcite.</p>

  <p>By changes of the foregoing kinds, many crystalline rocks are much
    altered. Some become <i>chloritic</i> from the development of the
    soft, green hydrated mineral, chlorite, derived from the pyroxene,
    amphibole, biotite, and perhaps other silicates of the original rock.
    Others become <i>talcose</i> from the development of talc, a very soft,
    unctuous, hydrous magnesian silicate developed from the magnesian
    minerals of the original rock. <i>Soapstone</i> or <i>steatite</i> is a
    rock composed essentially of such secondary material. <i>Serpentine</i>
    is a rock made up of a similar secondary mineral (serpentine)
    apparently derived from chrysolite (olivine) and other magnesian
    minerals. <i>Epidote</i>, a complex lime-iron-alumina silicate, often
    recognizable by its peculiar pistachio-green color, is derived from
    other silicates, and is rather common in many varieties of crystalline
    rocks. <i>Melaphyre</i> is a name applied rather loosely and variously
    to certain altered basic rocks of the basalt family. <i>Diabase</i> is
    essentially an altered dolerite. Nearly all the very ancient basaltic
    rocks show notable degrees of alteration, even though they appear to
    have escaped unusual dynamic conditions since their original formation,
    and hence their alteration seems to have resulted chiefly from the
    operation of unobtrusive agencies, chief among which is the circulation
    of water.</p>

  <h4><i>The Salient Features of Rock Descent.</i></h4>

  <p>The foregoing processes by which primitive or igneous rocks are
    disintegrated and their constituents converted into fragmental material
    may be said to constitute <i>the descent of rocks</i> in its fuller
    sense. Viewed chemically, the great features of the process are (1)
    the breaking down of the complex silicates, and (2) the gathering
    of the resultant simpler silicates (mainly aluminum silicates) into
    the silt and clay beds, (3) the assembling of a large part of the
    free acidic element (the quartz) into the sand and gravel beds, and
    (4) the concentration of a large part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span> of the earthy basic element
    (the calcium, magnesium, and iron oxides) into the calcareous,
    magnesian, and iron deposits, while (5) a large part of the alkaline
    basic remainder (the sodium, and potassium oxides) is dissolved and
    held in the sea-water. Physically, the great features are (1) the
    disaggregation of the antecedent rock, and (2) the separation from
    one another of products which are physically unlike, that is, the
    coarser from the finer, and the heavier from the lighter, and (3) the
    aggregation of these diverse materials in more or less distinct beds.
    It is to be noted that while the rearrangement of the sediments is
    made on the basis of their physical characters, it results in chemical
    differentiation as well, for the products of rock decay, which are
    physically diverse, are often chemically diverse as well. The physical
    assortment and the stratification are to be looked upon as a step in
    the direction of a simpler grouping of the material. On the whole, the
    process is descensional in character.</p>

  <h3>THE REASCENSIONAL PROCESS.</h3>

  <p>Running hand in hand with this descensional process, there has
    always been a reascensional process by which the coherence, the
    crystallization, and in some measure the complex composition of the
    rocks are restored. This is partially due to external mechanical
    agencies, but chiefly to internal chemical and molecular forces.</p>

  <p>Two general phases of this reconstructional work are recognized. The
    first, simplest and most universal, is that by which the incoherent
    materials produced by the descensional processes, i.e., the muds,
    sands, and clastic materials generally, are hardened into firm,
    coherent shales, sandstones, and limestones, and incidentally more or
    less changed in composition and molecular arrangement. The second is
    that by which more profound changes of induration and of composition
    are wrought, bringing the rock back to a state resembling its original
    crystalline character. This is known as <i>metamorphism</i>. Often,
    however, it is but an extension and intensification of the more
    common processes of the first class. Metamorphism is essentially
    reconstruction.</p>

  <p><b>Induration under ordinary pressures and temperatures.—</b>All
    kinds of loose fragmental material, whether soils, earths, clays,
    sands, gravels, volcanic ashes, cinders, or other forms of clastic or
    pyroclastic material, may become hardened into firm rock either by
    <i>pressure</i>, or by <i>cementation</i>, or by both. Pressure and
    cementation commonly act together and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span> aid each other. The ordinary
    pressures arise from the weight of the overlying material, and these
    of course increase with depth. Extraordinary pressures arise from the
    shrinkage of the earth and perhaps from other sources. The fragments
    of the clastic material, on being pressed together for long periods,
    weld more or less at the points of contact. If they are irregular,
    angular, or elongate, they come to interlock more or less like the
    fragments of macadam, and this coöperates with the welding. The process
    is greatly aided by water-bearing solutions of lime, silica, etc. which
    are deposited at the points where the fragments press upon each other.
    It is here that the capillary spaces are most minute and deposition
    is most liable to take place. Sometimes a film of mineral matter is
    laid down over the surfaces of the fragments and serves to bind them
    together. This process goes on wherever the ground-waters are in a
    depositing condition, just as the opposite process of disintegration
    takes place wherever the waters are in a solvent state. At and near the
    surface of the land, the waters are usually in the latter condition and
    disintegration is in progress, as already noted, but this is not always
    so. At times and places, the water from within the rock-mass may come
    to the surface and evaporate, and in so doing leave all its dissolved
    material on the surface, or within the outer pores of the mass, as
    cementing material. The exterior thus becomes firmly bound together,
    “case-hardened,” as it is termed. This may be seen in the drying of
    a lump of mud, the exterior of which often becomes quite firm. It is
    seen in quarry-rock, especially sandstone, which is sometimes soft and
    easily worked when taken wet from the earth, but which hardens as the
    water—the “sap” of the quarrymen—dries out and deposits its solutes in
    the capillary spaces of the grains of the surface. It is obvious that
    it is the very last of the “sap” which contains the most concentrated
    solutes, and that this last remnant is held in the minute capillary
    spaces where the grains touch each other, and hence the last stage of
    drying leaves the cement at the points where it is most effective. In
    natural exposures of sandstone, the pores of the outer shell sometimes
    become almost completely filled in this way with silicious deposits,
    and the sandstone is changed into a quartzite.</p>

  <p>In the sea, and in the deep water underground, the common habit of
    the water is to deposit more than to dissolve, though it is doing
    more or less of both. As a rule, therefore, loose material in these
    situations becomes bound more or less firmly into rock, and hence
    what were originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span> loose sand beds become <i>sandstones</i>; what
    were soft muds become <i>shales</i> or <i>limestone</i>, according to
    composition; what was gravel becomes <i>conglomerate</i>; what was
    chipstone becomes <i>breccia</i>; what were volcanic ashes, cinders,
    and lapilli become <i>tuffs</i>; and what were masses of volcanic
    blocks and coarse fragments become <i>agglomerates</i>.</p>

  <p>The cementing process works at times in specially interesting ways. In
    quartz sandstones, the grains are worn fragments of quartz crystals,
    formed originally in quartz-bearing rock. The crystalline force in
    these remnants controls the arrangement of the new molecules of silica
    deposited about them. The result is that the new deposits tend to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
    build up the original forms of the crystals from which the sand grains
    were derived (<a href="#fig354"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 354</a>). Sometimes a film of iron oxide has formed
    about the grain of sand before the addition of the new silica. This, or
    some difference of color, may clearly distinguish the original grain
    from subsequent additions. Sometimes the adjacent grains of sandstone
    are rebuilt in this way until the interstices are completely filled.
    When this has been accomplished, the sandstone becomes a quartzite
    (<a href="#fig355"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 355</a>). Most quartzites indeed appear to have been formed in this
    way, but mainly under special conditions that promote the deposition
    of silica. Grains of other minerals, such as feldspar, are subject to
    similar secondary enlargement (<a href="#fig356"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 356</a>).</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Sometimes the new material is deposited in the form of concentric
    shells about the particles of sediment, building them up into little
    spheres. Rock formed of such spherules is known as <i>oolite</i>, from
    the resemblance of the grains to the roe of fish (<a href="#fig357"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 357</a>). Sometimes
    the nuclei of the concretions are grains of quartz sand, and the added
    concentric layers are of calcium carbonate. In this case the structure
    is quite obvious; but perhaps more frequently the nuclei are minute
    and difficult to identify, and the concentric shells make up the main
    mass of the grains. Certain formations, as the oolitic limestone of
    Indiana and elsewhere, and the Upper and Lower Oolites of England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
    are characterized by this structure. In most cases these accretions
    probably grew in depositing waters that gently rolled the grains while
    layers were being added. They thus do not fall under the head of
    cementation after the beds were formed; but concentric additions to the
    grains appear sometimes to have taken place after they were formed into
    beds.</p>

      in layers, apparently over the bottom, until the cavity was nearly
      obliterated.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p><b>Cavity filling.—</b>When cavities of some size occur in rocks and
    the percolating waters are in a depositing state, the interiors of
    the cavities are sometimes lined with concentric layers of deposit.
    Here, instead of building <i>out</i> from a nucleus, the waters build
    <i>in</i> from the walls of the cavity. The <i>agate structure</i>
    (<a href="#fig358"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 358</a>) is a case of this kind, in which the successive layers are
    commonly silica in the form of chalcedony and differ from each other
    in color and texture. Often before the cavity is entirely filled, the
    deposit changes from chalcedony, to crystals of quartz, which grow with
    their bases on the walls and their pyramidal points toward the center
    of the cavity. <i>Geodes</i> are examples of a similar process in which
    the cavity is but partially filled with crystals which have their bases
    set on the walls of the cavity and their points directed inwards (<a href="#fig359"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    359</a>). The crystals of geodes are most commonly quartz or calcite,
    but they may be any other mineral that the waters are capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
    depositing. Very large cavities lined in this way are known to miners
    as <i>vuggs</i>, and these grade on into caves lined with crystals and
    with <i>stalactite</i> and <i>stalagmite</i>. These are the largest
    expression of the solidifying process by means of internal deposition.</p>

  <p><b>Fissure-filling; veins.—</b>Cracks, crevices, and fissures filled
    by deposition in a similar way give rise to <i>veins</i> (<a href="#fig360"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 360</a>).
    Here the filling grows from the walls toward the center, and hence
    often has a banded appearance. By this filling of cracks and crevices,
    the circulating water heals the breaks in the rocks. Frequently a
    crushed zone is thus restored to a solid state. When the fissures
    are deep and wide and traverse different formations, conditions are
    afforded for very complex deposits, and for the concentration of
    rare and valuable material originally dispersed through a great mass
    of rock. Ore deposition in such veins is usually treated as a theme
    by itself, but it is really but a declared expression of the work
    which the percolating waters are doing throughout all the rocks which
    they penetrate. Most of the fine crystals that grace mineralogical
    collections were formed in cavities and fissures by deposition from
    circulating mineralized waters.</p>

  <p><b>Solution as well as deposition.—</b>A further phase of the process
    needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span> attention. The percolating waters are constantly taking up
    matter as well as throwing it down, and so, while they are cementing
    fragments together and healing fractures, they are also removing
    material, and a rock may be growing porous and cavernous at the same
    time that its fragments are being united. Cavities may be formed at
    one stage and filled at another; matter may be taken up at one point
    and put down at another, and so an internal reconstruction is in slow
    progress.</p>

    Surv.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Concretions.—</b>A notable phase of this internal reconstruction
    is the assembling together of like kinds of matter. For instance,
    silica that was probably deposited in the form of the silicious shells
    and spicules of plants and animals, and was disseminated through the
    sediments as originally formed, is aggregated into nodules of chert
    or flint (<a href="#fig361"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 361</a>); similarly, concretions of ferrous carbonate or
    calcium carbonate grow in sands, silts, or muds; clusters of crystals
    of pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>), of sphalerite (ZnS), and galenite (PbS) are formed
    in clayey layers, pressing the clay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span> back as they grow; and in many
    other cases, kind comes to kind. Some concretions probably form during
    the accumulation of the beds in which they lie.</p>

  <p><b>Replacements and pseudomorphs.—</b>So also there are replacements,
    sometimes resulting in imitative or false forms. Frequently the calcium
    carbonate of corals, molluscan shells, etc., is replaced by silica, and
    this substitution is brought about so gradually, particle by particle,
    that the minutest details of structure are sometimes fully preserved.
    This is often of great service in their study, since the limestone
    in which they are imbedded may often be dissolved away, while the
    silicified fossil is unaffected. So woody matter is sometimes replaced
    by silica, forming silicified wood. Similarly, the molecules of one
    crystal are sometimes replaced by different material, as the molecules
    of calcite by zinc carbonate, giving a pseudomorph of zinc carbonate
    after calcite.</p>

    size. (Photo. by Church.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Incipient crystallization.—</b>A more general change is incipient
    crystallization. Some common limestones and dolomites are now largely
    made up of small crystals, though the mass was originally a calcareous
    mud or ooze. Incipient crystals are formed in shales and other
    sediments. This process, like the preceding, is a kind of incipient
    metamorphism or reconstruction, but it is a pervasive process, taking
    place under ordinary conditions of heat and pressure, and through the
    agency of circulating ground-waters.</p>

  <p>By these and similar processes the fragmental deposits are solidified
    into firm rock and undergo internal changes which more or less
    reorganize the matter of which they are composed. The process is a very
    slow one usually. Some of the sands and muds of very early geologic
    ages are yet imperfectly solidified; e.g., much of the St. Peter’s
    sandstone, a very ancient formation, is yet so incoherent as to break
    down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span> into sand in being dug out, and is used for mortar sand much more
    than for building stone. Some of the Hudson River shales of scarcely
    less age are more nearly clay than hard rock. But these are examples of
    excessive slowness and slightness of change. In general, all but the
    most recent deposits show notable progress in reconstruction.</p>

  <h4><i>Reconstruction under Exceptional Conditions.</i></h4>

  <p>Two special conditions greatly influence changes in rocks, viz.,
    pressure and heat. Their action gives rise to three general cases,
    but these blend indefinitely: (1) exceptional pressure without great
    heat, (2) great heat without exceptional pressure, and (3) great heat
    and great pressure conjoined. Exceptional pressure may arise from the
    weight of overlying rocks, or from lateral thrust due to the shrinkage
    of the globe, and occasionally from other causes. Exceptional heat may
    arise from pressure, from the intrusion of hot lavas, and occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
    from other sources. In the case of intruded lavas there may or may not
    be exceptional pressure. Thrust usually gives heat as well as pressure,
    but if lateral thrust acts on rocks near the surface, they may be
    mashed into new forms without becoming very exceptionally heated,
    though some rise of temperature is inevitable.</p>

  <p>(1) <b>Slaty structure.—</b>When rocks made up of clastic particles
    are compressed in a given direction and are relatively free to expand
    at right angles to the direction of pressure, the particles that are
    already elongated tend to take positions with their longer axes at
    right angles to the direction of pressure, and all particles, whether
    elongate or not, are more or less flattened in a plane transverse
    to the direction of pressure. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span> may be readily seen where the
    particles are large (<a href="#fig362"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 362</a>). As a result of the orientation and
    flattening of their particles, rocks so affected split more readily
    between the elongate and flattened particles than across them. In
    other words, the rocks cleave along planes normal to the direction of
    compression, and break with difficulty and with rough fracture across
    the planes of cleavage. The condition thus induced is known as slaty
    structure (<a href="#fig363"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 363</a>), and is best illustrated by roofing-slate, which
    was originally a mud, later a shale, and finally assumed the slaty
    condition under strong compression. Sometimes the original bedding
    may still be seen running across the induced cleavage planes (<a href="#fig364"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    364</a>). As the original mud beds were horizontal or nearly so, and as
    the thrust is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span> usually horizontal or nearly so, the induced cleavage
    commonly crosses the bedding planes at a high angle (<a href="#fig364"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 364</a>); but
    after the beds are tilted or bent, the lines of pressure take new
    directions relative to the bedding planes, and the angles between the
    original bedding and the slaty cleavages usually become smaller, and
    may even disappear in exceptional cases. Limestones, sandstones, and
    conglomerates are not so easily compressed as mudstones, and they
    usually take on only an imperfect cleavage normal to the direction of
    pressure. Often they merely show some little compacting, while the
    shaly strata between them are converted into slate. Obviously the
    direction of slaty cleavage may be used to determine the direction of
    the compressing force, and is thus serviceable in dynamic studies.</p>

  <p><b>Foliation, schistosity.—</b>A more intense application of pressure
    in a given direction is capable of breaking down and deforming the most
    resistant rock. This must necessarily be attended with the evolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
    of much heat, and thermal effects are mingled with pressure effects,
    but the thermal effects may be neglected for the moment. The first
    stage of the mechanical effect of the compression may be to crush the
    rock more or less. It thus becomes granular or fragmental, and is
    really a peculiar species of clastic rock (<i>autoclastic</i>). At a
    further stage, the fragmented material may be pressed into layers or
    leaves, much as in the development of slaty cleavage, but as a result
    of the nature of the material, the cleavage is less perfect. This is
    often attended by more or less shearing of the material upon itself,
    and thus a rude fissility and foliation is developed. The result,
    including the attendant metamorphism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span> about to be described, is a
    <i>foliated</i> or <i>schistose structure</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig365">365</a> and <a href="#fig366">366</a>). Even
    the most massive rocks may be reduced to the foliated form by this
    process; thus, a granite may be mashed into a <i>gneiss</i>—which is a
    granite in composition, but has a foliated structure—or a basalt may be
    converted into a <i>schist</i>, a common term for foliated crystalline
    rocks. Porphyritic rock rendered schistose by pressure is shown in <a href="#fig366"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    366</a>. When massive rocks like granite or basalt are thus crushed down
    into the foliated form, the process is in a sense degradational. It is
    a kind of <i>katamorphism</i> or downward change. It is often difficult
    to differentiate the schists thus derived by degrading massive rocks,
    from those developed by ascensional processes from clastic formations
    (<i>anamorphism</i>). The action of heat is important in the evolution
    of schists of both classes, but the effects of heat may best be taken
    up where it acts measurably alone.</p>

  <p><b>Metamorphism by heat.—</b>When a mass of lava is poured out upon the
    surface, it bakes the mantle-rock which it overruns, in greater or less
    degree, depending on the mass and temperature. The nature of the effect
    is much the same as in the process of brick-making, a dehydration of
    the material, a hardening of the loose matter by the partial welding of
    the particles, and sometimes the partial fusion of the surface and the
    development of new compounds, usually glassy, but sometimes partially
    crystalline. In both the natural and the artificial process, the time
    element is short, the pressure trivial, and the water action limited.
    If the heat were to become sufficiently intense, the result would be
    fusion, i.e., a lava which would solidify into a glass. In such a case,
    the rock cycle would be carried back to the initial molten state and a
    new cycle instituted, but this does not usually take place when lava
    merely overflows the surface.</p>

  <p>If lavas, instead of rising to the surface, wedge in between layers
    of rock and form <i>sills</i>, or interstratified sheets, the surface
    above as well as that below is baked, and as the excess of heat of the
    lava can only escape through the neighboring rock, the effects for
    a given mass of lava are more considerable, and as the time element
    and the water action (and sometimes the pressure) are usually greater
    than in the case of extruded lavas, the effects tend rather toward
    chemical and crystalline change than to simple baking. This tendency
    increases with increase in the mass of the lava and in its temperature.
    Sometimes enormous masses of very hot lava are thrust in between or
    among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span> strata that lie beneath the surface, and bring to bear upon
    them intense heat for a long period. So also, when a vent or fissure is
    the passageway for lavas that continue to come to the surface for long
    periods, as in the case of persistent volcanoes, the rocks which form
    the walls of the vent or fissure are heated for a long time, and this
    gives rise to metamorphism through heat, without very unusual pressure,
    but usually with the free aid of water. In these cases the chief effect
    is chemical recombination and crystallization. In the limestones and
    sandstones it is simple; in the shales more complex. In pure limestones
    and dolomites little chemical change takes place, but the molecules are
    rearranged into larger and more perfect crystals, and <i>marble</i>
    is the result. The coarseness of the crystals is, in a general way,
    a measure of the length of time during which the heat acts, and of
    its intensity, but much depends on the freedom of the attendant water
    circulation. Crystals an inch or two across are sometimes formed in
    the contact zone, where the attendant water action is important. If
    impurities, as silica, alumina, iron, etc., are present, various
    minerals, such as <i>tremolite</i> and <i>actinolite</i>, may be formed
    in the marble. In pure quartzose sandstones, the effect is to cause the
    building up of the quartz grains until the interspaces are essentially
    filled and the whole becomes a massive <i>quartzite</i>. Here, as in
    the marbles, impurities form adventitious crystals, a very common one
    being <i>hematite</i>, formed from the segregation of the ferric oxide
    of the sandstone.</p>

  <p>In the shales, the material to be acted upon is more complex, for,
    while the main mass is an aluminum silicate, there is usually much
    free quartz, not a little potash and iron, and more or less of lime,
    magnesia, soda, and other ingredients, for the muds from which the
    shales arose contained not only the fully decomposed matter of the
    original crystalline rocks, but the fine matter worn from them by
    wind and water without decomposition. When this mixed matter is acted
    upon by high heat and moisture, it tends to return to its original
    crystalline state, so far as its changed constitution permits. The
    potash chiefly unites with alumina and silica, and forms potash
    feldspar (orthoclase chiefly) and potash mica (muscovite). The iron
    often unites with magnesia, alumina, and silica to form biotite or one
    of the ferromagnesian minerals, chiefly an amphibole. The lime usually
    aids in the formation of other silicates of either the feldspar or
    the ferromagnesian group, while the surplus silica crystallizes into
    quartz. There is usually a predisposition to form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span> mica in preference
    to other silicates if the proper constituents are present, and the
    result is that <i>mica schists</i> and <i>gneisses</i>, in which mica
    abounds, are common products of the metamorphism of shales by contact
    with bodies of lava. Mica schists and micaceous gneisses are also
    formed in other ways, and other schists, dependent on the composition
    of the shales, are formed about intrusions of igneous rock. In all
    such cases pressure probably attends the heat and is a factor in the
    development of the schists. When the change induced by the heat is less
    considerable, the shale is baked, with incipient recrystallization, and
    often takes the form of <i>argillite</i>, a compact, massive sort of
    shale.</p>

  <p>Beds of hydrous iron oxide (limonite) or of iron carbonate (siderite)
    are usually converted by heat into hematite or magnetite. Beds of peat,
    lignite, and bituminous coal are converted into anthracite by the
    driving off of the volatile hydrocarbons. If the process goes to the
    extreme, graphite is the result.</p>

  <p><b>Metamorphism by heat and lateral pressure.—</b>As already indicated,
    the more common intense pressures experienced by rocks at and near
    the surface are those that come from lateral thrusts arising from the
    shrinkage of the earth. These affect one dimension of the rock-mass,
    while they permit it to expand in one or both of the other dimensions.
    This produces a strain in all the constituent particles of the rock,
    and under such strain they pass more readily into solution than when
    free from strain, and more readily rearrange their molecules internally
    into positions of less strain. The crystals grow most freely along the
    planes of least stress, i.e., at right angles to the pressure.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> As
    a consequence, where unidimensional pressure and high heat resulting
    from the compression unite their influence, the metamorphic changes
    are not only facilitated, but the rearrangement is controlled by the
    pressure and results in a parallel arrangement of the constituent
    crystals, giving a foliated or schistose character to the new rock.
    The changes themselves are much the same as those produced by heat
    and water without exceptional pressure, though some distinctions may
    be noted. It is to be observed, however, that two kinds of work are
    embraced here: the metamorphism of clastic rocks into crystalline
    schists, which may be regarded as an upbuilding process, anamorphism,
    and the mashing down of massive crystalline rocks into schists, which
    may be regarded <span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>as a degradational process, katamorphism. In both
    cases, however, there is solution and rearrangement of the molecules.
    The katamorphism of basalts and other basic rocks gives basic schists;
    that of granitic and similar rocks gives gneisses. The anamorphism of
    basic pyroclastic tuffs and wackes gives basic schists, while that
    of acid pyroclastics and most shales gives gneisses, mica schists,
    or similar acidic schists. It is obvious that ordinary shales cannot
    usually become basic schists, because in producing the original
    muds, the bases were generally removed; but when shales are highly
    calcareous and magnesian, as when they grade toward the limestones and
    dolomites, they may become basic schists by metamorphism, e.g., certain
    hornblendic schists. It is even more obvious that the limestone and
    sandstone formations must largely retain their distinct composition. It
    is thus seen that, in general, a sedimentary series anamorphosed must
    differ from a crystalline series katamorphosed, though both give rise
    to foliated or schistose rocks.</p>

  <p><b>Deep-seated metamorphism.—</b>When the exceptional pressure arises
    from the weight of rocks felt at great depth, it is practically
    equal in all directions and the crystallization probably develops
    normally and is not forced into the parallel or foliated form. Rocks
    metamorphosed under these conditions probably tend to take the massive
    form rather than the schistose form, but this conclusion is theoretical
    rather than observational, for little or nothing is known of the
    history of such rocks.</p>

  <p><b>Completion of the rock cycle.—</b>The crystallizing processes of
    metamorphism are fundamentally similar to the processes by which rocks
    crystallize out of magmas, only in the first case the work is done
    chiefly by the aid of an aqueous solution, while in the second it is
    done through a mutual solution of the constituents in themselves,
    where water was but an incident. If the heat factor in metamorphism
    be sufficiently increased, aqueous solution may actually grade into
    magmatic solution through various degrees of softening and melting, and
    the cycle of changes be closed in upon itself.</p>

  <h3>VARIOUS CLASSIFICATIONS AND NOMENCLATURES.</h3>

  <p>From the foregoing sketch of the processes of rock-making it may easily
    be inferred that the varieties of rocks may be almost unlimited, and
    that they may be defined, named, and classified on many different
    bases; for example.</p>

  <p>(1) If <i>the mode of origin</i> is chiefly in mind, rocks may be
    classed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span> <i>igneous</i> (lavas, tuffs, etc.); <i>metamorphic</i>
    (schists, gneisses, anthracite, magnetite, etc.); <i>aqueous</i>
    (water-laid sediments, stalactites, travertine, etc.); <i>eolian</i>
    (dunes, loess in part); <i>glacial</i> (till, moraines); <i>clastic</i>
    (mantle-rock, sandstone, conglomerate, etc.); <i>organic</i> (peat,
    lignite, coal, etc., and indirectly, limestone, chalk, infusorial
    earth, etc.); and so on.</p>

  <p>(2) If the <i>textural or structural characters</i> are in mind,
    rocks are designated vesicular (pumice, scoria, etc.); rhyolitic
    (flow-structure rocks); glassy (obsidian, tachylite); porphyritic
    (distinct crystals in obscure matrix); granitic (well-grained);
    compact, porous, earthy, arenaceous (sandy), schistose, etc.</p>

  <p>(3) If the <i>chemical composition</i> is chiefly regarded, they may
    be classed as silicious, calcareous, carbonaceous, ferruginous, etc.;
    or, if the <i>chemical nature</i> is considered, they are grouped as
    acidic, basic, or neutral.</p>

  <p>(4) If the <i>crystalline character</i> is made the basis, they
    are designated phanerocrystalline (distinctly crystallized),
    microcrystalline (minutely crystallized), cryptocrystalline (hiddenly
    crystallized), and amorphous (non-crystalline).</p>

  <p>(5) If attention is fastened on <i>certain ingredients</i>, rocks
    are characterized as quartzose, micaceous, chloritic, talcose,
    pyritiferous, garnetiferous, etc.</p>

  <p>(6) When rocks are regarded as <i>mineral aggregates</i>, if (<i>a</i>)
    the <i>aggregates are simple</i>, they are named from the dominant
    minerals, as dolomite, hornblendite, garnetite, anorthite, etc.; and if
    (<i>b</i>) the <i>aggregates are complex</i> they take special names,
    as syenite (orthoclase and hornblende), gabbro (plagioclase feldspar
    and pyroxene), etc.</p>

  <p>(7) When the point of view is <i>structure of the mass</i>, they are
    classed as massive, stratified, shaly, laminated, slaty, foliated,
    schistose, etc.</p>

  <p>(8) When <i>physical state</i> or <i>genesis</i> is considered, they
    are grouped as clastic, fragmental, or detrital (conglomeratic,
    brecciated, arenaceous, argillaceous, etc.); or pyroclastic (tufaceous,
    scoriaceous, agglomeratic); or massive, in a sense slightly different
    from that above (7).</p>

  <p>As sometimes one of these characteristics and sometimes another is most
    important in a given rock, or in a given study, no one classification
    is satisfactory in all cases, yet each has its advantages in particular
    cases.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span></p>

  <h4><i>New System of Classification and Nomenclature.</i></h4>

  <p>The present systems of classifying and naming rocks have grown up
    gradually out of earlier and cruder methods, many of which were
    inherited from popular usage. Most of the names and definitions came
    into use before microscopical and other modern means of study were
    adopted. These systems, therefore, retain many inherited crudities
    and inconsistencies, and lack adaptation to present needs. They are
    too complex and difficult for field use and for general discussions,
    while not sufficiently exact and systematic for the more rigorous
    petrological discussions. A more adaptive and consistent practice
    has been earnestly sought by petrologists, and a new system of
    classification of igneous rocks has been offered by a group of leading
    American petrologists, an outline of which is here given.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> To
    some extent this may be extended to the metamorphic crystalline
    rocks with necessary modifications and additions. The classification
    and nomenclature of the secondary rocks must probably always remain
    variable and plastic to express the various points of view which it
    is desirable to take. During the transition to this or some other new
    system, which seems inevitable, the appended alphabetical reference
    lists of the most common minerals and rocks, with brief definitions in
    accordance with current usage, will be found serviceable. The proposed
    system includes two parts, a <i>field system</i> and a <i>quantitative
      system</i>, the one applicable to rocks on casual inspection, and the
    other, only after detailed study.</p>

  <h4><i>The proposed field system.</i></h4>

  <p>The proposed field names are based largely on <i>texture</i> and
    <i>color</i>. The mineral constituents are used for subdivisions when
    they can be determined; otherwise they are neglected.</p>

  <p>Classifying chiefly on the basis of texture and crystalline state,
    there are three groups: <i>Phanerites</i>, in which all the leading
    mineral constituents can be seen megascopically; <i>aphanites</i>, in
    which all, or at least an appreciable part, of the constituent minerals
    cannot be distinguished megascopically; and <i>glasses</i>, in which
    the material is wholly or largely vitreous.</p>

  <p>I. The <b>Phanerites</b> may be further classified by their chief
    mineral constituents as follows:</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span></p>

  <p>1. <i>Granites</i> (f.n.),<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> consisting largely of <i>quartz</i>
    and <i>feldspar</i> of any kind, with or without mica, hornblende,
    pyroxene, or other minerals. This differs from the present common
    use in not regarding mica as an essential constituent, and in not
    distinguishing between alkali feldspars and calcic feldspars, thus
    broadening the class.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Syenites</i> (f.n.), consisting predominantly of <i>feldspar</i>
    of any kind, with subordinate amounts of hornblende, mica, or pyroxene,
    but with little or no quartz. This differs from the common use in
    giving hornblende a subordinate place, and in embracing rocks with
    calcic feldspars, thus broadening the class.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Diorites</i> (f.n.), consisting predominantly of
    <i>hornblende</i> and subordinately of <i>feldspar</i> of any kind,
    with which there may be mica, pyroxene, or other minerals. This is
    nearly the present use except that any kind of feldspar may form the
    subordinate element.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Gabbros</i> (f.n.), consisting predominantly of <i>pyroxene</i>
    and subordinately of <i>feldspar</i> of any kind, with or without other
    minerals. This nearly coincides with one of the various present uses of
    the term except that the range of the feldspar is increased.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Dolerites</i><a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> (f.n.), consisting predominantly of <i>any
    ferromagnesian mineral</i> not distinguishable as hornblende or
    pyroxene, with subordinate elements of <i>feldspar</i> of any kind,
    and with or without other accessory minerals. A name to be used
    when the dominant mineral is clearly ferromagnesian, but cannot be
    satisfactorily identified as either hornblende or pyroxene, although it
    may probably be one of these. In other words, the dolerites (deceptive)
    embrace the whole diorite-gabbro group when too obscure for separation.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Peridotites</i>, consisting predominantly of <i>olivine</i> and
    <i>ferromagnesian minerals</i>, <i>without</i> feldspar, or with very
    little.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Pyroxenite</i>, consisting essentially of pyroxene without
    feldspar or olivine.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Hornblendite</i>, consisting essentially of hornblende without
    feldspar or olivine.</p>

  <p>II. The <b>Aphanites</b> may be <i>non-porphyritic</i> or
    <i>porphyritic</i>.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Non-porphyritic aphanites when light-colored may be classed
    as <i>felsites</i>; when dark-colored, as <i>basalts</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span></p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) The porphyritic aphanites or <i>porphyries</i>, when
    light-colored, are <i>leucophyres</i>; when dark-colored, are
    <i>melaphyres</i> (f.n.). They may be classified further, according to
    the kind of phenocryst imbedded in the aphanitic ground-mass, as</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>Quartz-porphyries</i>, or quartzophyres;</li>
    <li><i>Feldspar-porphyries</i>, or feldspaphyres (not felsophyres);</li>
    <li><i>Hornblende-porphyries</i>, or hornblendophyres; and so on.</li>
    <li>These may be subclassed by color, as</li>
    <li><i>Quartz-leucophyres</i>, light-colored quartz-porphyries;</li>
    <li><i>Quartz-melaphyres</i>, dark-colored quartz-porphyries;</li>
    <li><i>Feldspar-leucophyres</i>;</li>
    <li><i>Feldspar-melaphyres</i>; and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>III. The glasses are classified, according to color and luster,
    into <i>obsidians</i> or <i>pitchstones</i> when dark and lustrous;
    <i>perlites</i>, when a spheroidal fracture gives them a pearly
    appearance; and <i>pumice</i> when greatly inflated by included gases.</p>

  <p>In general discussions, it is regarded as serviceable to use the term
    <i>granitoids</i> in a broad generic sense, to include all crystalline
    rocks of the general granitoid type, including the granites, syenites,
    gneisses, etc. In a similar broad way, the term <i>gabbroids</i> may be
    used to include the dark crystalline rocks in which the ferromagnesian
    minerals predominate, as the diorites, gabbros, dolerites, peridotites,
    etc. In this convenient and comprehensive way, two contrasted groups of
    igneous rocks may be designated. As the granitoids are usually acidic
    and the gabbroids usually basic, the grouping represents a broad fact
    of importance.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span></p>

  <h3>THE PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE SYSTEM.</h3>

  <p>The distinguishing characteristic of the more rigorous system designed
    to meet the needs of scientific petrology is its quantitative chemical
    character. All igneous rocks are classified <i>primarily</i> according
    to their chemical composition and only secondarily according to their
    mineral constituents, texture, and other characters. The rigorous
    application of the system requires chemical analyses of the rocks, but
    as these are not available in many cases, the authors of the system
    have devised a method of optical mineral analysis by which the nearly
    exact proportions of all the constituent minerals can be determined,
    and by knowledge of their chemical nature the results may be converted,
    by computation, into chemical terms. This can only be done for
    holocrystalline rocks whose crystals are large enough to be measured
    under the microscope, but aphanitic rocks may often be approximately
    classified by comparison with similar rocks already accurately
    determined. To facilitate this method of chemical analysis by measuring
    the minerals, the chemical composition of certain common rock-making
    minerals is expressed in proportional parts and tabulated, and is used
    somewhat as molecular weight is in ordinary chemical analysis. Certain
    of these are selected as <i>standard</i> minerals, the selection being
    such that the standard minerals embrace all the essential elements that
    enter into the composition of rocks. All other minerals are converted
    into their chemical equivalents in terms of these standard minerals by
    the use of the tables. All the mineral constituents being thus reduced
    to standard minerals, the classification is built up systematically on
    these standard (or standardized) minerals.</p>

  <p>A new system of names is required, and these have been very skillfully
    formed by selecting significant letters from the names of the leading
    minerals or from words signifying their preponderance, so that short
    terms which carry their meaning in their forms, are secured, and this
    has been done so that these are usually euphonious, however strange
    they may seem to our preoccupied senses. For example, minerals composed
    chiefly of <i>s</i>ilica and <i>al</i>umina are called <i>salic</i>;
    those of <i>fe</i>rro<i>m</i>agnesian minerals, <i>femic</i>; those
    of <i>al</i>uminous <i>fe</i>rromagnesian minerals, <i>alferric</i>,
    etc. When in a combination of salic and femic minerals, the salic
    are extremely abundant, the rock is <i>per</i>salic; if notably
    <i>do</i>minant, <i>do</i>salic; if the salic and femic minerals are
    nearly equal, <i>salfemic</i>; if the femic are <i>do</i>minant,
    <i>dofemic</i>; if extremely abundant, <i>per</i>femic, and so on, the
    system being mnemonic. This method of deriving names is applicable only
    to a portion of the necessary divisions. For the rest, a series of
    roots derived from geographic names, with a system of terminations, has
    been employed.</p>

  <p>All standard minerals are divided into two groups of primary
    importance: one of minerals characterized by alumina, as the
    feldspars,—orthoclase, albite, anorthite,—leucite, nephelite, sodalite,
    noselite, and corundum, to which are added the closely associated
    minerals, quartz and zircon. This is called the <i>salic</i> group. The
    second group contains minerals characterized by iron and magnesia with
    no alumina, as hypersthene (enstatite), acmite, olivine, magnetite,
    hematite, and ilmenite, to which are added the closely associated
    minerals, titanite, perofskite, rutile, apatite, and all other
    rock-making minerals except those containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span> alumina together with
    iron and magnesia. The second group is called <i>femic</i>.</p>

  <p>Aluminous ferromagnesian minerals, such as hornblende, augite, mica,
    etc.; are called <i>alferric</i>, and are not classed as standard
    minerals, because their complexity of composition makes it better to
    treat them as though made up of the simpler minerals of the standard
    list.</p>

  <p>The composition of all igneous rocks can be expressed in terms of the
    relative proportions of the two groups of the standard minerals, salic
    and femic. By subdividing these groups successively on a mineral and
    chemical basis, a series of classificatory divisions of greater and
    greater precision has been formed. In each stage of the series, two
    factors only are compared, and a simple set of ratios has been selected
    to limit the divisions. Assuming the possibility of a continuous range
    of variable mixtures of the two factors (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) from
    an extreme composed wholly of one (<i>A</i>), and an extreme composed
    wholly of the other (<i>B</i>), five ideal cases have been chosen as
    types or centerpoints about which variation in mixture may take place.
    These are:</p>

  <p>Each of these classes is divided into two <i>subclasses</i> according
    to the proportions of two subgroups of the preponderant group of
    standard minerals. Of salic minerals one subgroup includes quartz,
    feldspars, and the feldspathoids; the other includes corundum and
    zircon. Of femic minerals one subgroup includes the silicates with
    magnetite, ilmenite, hematite, and rutile; the other contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span> apatite
    and the remaining minerals of this group. Most known igneous rocks fall
    into the first subclass of each class.</p>

  <p>The classes are further divided into <i>orders</i> according to the
    proportions of certain minerals in the preponderant subgroups. Thus
    Classes I, II, and III are each divided into nine orders on a basis of
    the proportions of quartz and the feldspars, and of the feldspars and
    the feldspathoids, quartz and feldspathoids not occurring together. The
    orders may be described in the same terms for each of the first three
    classes as follows:</p>

  <p>In classes IV and V the preponderant minerals are femic, and in
    subclass 1 they are silicates, titanates, and ferrates, with hematite
    and rutile. These are subdivided as follows:</p>

  <p>Silicates—pyroxenes and olivine with akermanite in one subgroup;
    the other minerals, magnetite, hematite, ilmenite, titanite,
    perofskite, rutile, in the second subgroup. This first group is called
    <i>polic</i>, mnemonic of pyroxene and olivine; the second group is
    called <i>mitic</i>, mnemonic of magnetite, ilmenite, titanite.</p>

  <p>There are five orders in each of these classes, as follows:</p>

  <p>Further subdivision, producing rangs and subrangs, is made on the
    character of the chemical bases in the standard minerals used in
    forming orders and is expressed in terms of the molecular proportions
    of certain oxides. For the salic minerals, forming orders in the first
    three classes, the bases are alkalies—K<sub>2</sub>O and Na<sub>2</sub>O—and lime,
    CaO. For the femic minerals, forming orders in the last two classes,
    the bases are MgO, FeO, CaO and alkalies, K<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O. In classes
    I, II, and III rangs are formed by comparing salic alkalies, K<sub>2</sub>O′ +
    Na<sub>2</sub>O′, with salic lime, CaO′; and subrangs are formed by comparing

  <p>Finally a recognition of the character of the subordinate standard
    minerals leads to further subdivisions known as <i>grads</i> and
    <i>subgrads</i>. They only occur in classes II, III, and IV, because
    these are the only ones in which the subordinate minerals are in
    notable amounts. <i>Grads</i> are formed in a manner similar to that
    employed to produce orders. Thus grads in classes II and III correspond
    to orders in class IV and the reverse. Subgrads are the same in form
    as rangs when the difference in the treatment of salic and femic
    minerals is borne in mind. The names given to these divisions, which
    in fact recognize only the character of the magma, are derived from
    geographical localities and embrace many of those already in use,
    except that the names of orders are taken from countries or nations.
    Specific terminations indicate the place in the series of divisions:</p>

  <p><i>ane</i> for class, <i>one</i> for subclass.</p>
  <p><i>are</i> for order, <i>ore</i> for suborder.</p>
  <p><i>ase</i> for rang, <i>ose</i> for subrang.</p>
  <p><i>ate</i> for grad, <i>ote</i> for subgrad.</p>

  <p>This may be illustrated as follows:</p>

  <p>Class I. <i>persalane</i>, all rocks extremely salic.</p>

  <p>Order 4. <i>britannare</i>, feldspar dominant over quartz, quardofelic.
    Many rocks of granitic composition whether crystalline or glassy.</p>

  <p>Rang 1. <i>liparase</i>, peralkalic, rocks in which the potential
    feldspars are extremely alkalic, orthoclase, or albite.</p>

  <p>Subrang 2. <i>Omeose</i>, dopotassic, rocks in which the extremely
    alkali feldspars are dominantly potassic, orthoclase, with subordinate
    albite. Examples of omeose are: granite from Omeo, Victoria, Australia,
    and rhyolite from Silver Cliff, Colorado.</p>

  <p>The presence of distinctive minerals not indicated in the standard
    mineral composition of <i>norm</i> is expressed by qualifying
    the magmatic name by the name of the distinctive mineral; as, a
    hornblende-monzonose.</p>

  <p>The precise texture of the rock is expressed by qualifying the magmatic
    name by a textural adjective; as, a grano-monzonose, a vitro-monzonose,
    a phyro-monzonose, etc.</p>

  <h3>ORE-DEPOSITS.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></h3>

  <p>Ore-deposits are but a special phase of the rock-forming processes
    already discussed. They have peculiar interest because of their
    industrial value. An ore is simply a rock that contains a metal that
    can be profitably extracted, though for convenience the term is used
    more broadly to include unworkable lean ores and ore material. The
    metal need not preponderate or form any fixed percentage of the whole,
    for the criterion is solely economic and not petrologic. A gold ore
    rarely contains more than a very small fraction of one percent. of the
    precious metal, while high-grade iron ore yields sixty-odd percent.
    of the metal. In iron ore, the metallic oxide or carbonate makes up
    nearly the whole rock; in gold ore, the metal is the merest incidental
    constituent, from the petrologic point of view.</p>

  <p><b>Concentration.—</b>The essential fact in the formation of ores is
    the unusual concentration of the metal. There are vast quantities of
    all the metals disseminated through the rock substance of the earth
    and even throughout the hydrosphere, but they do not constitute
    ores because they have no economic value. They become ores when
    concentrated in accessible places to a workable richness. The degree
    of concentration required is measured by the value of the metal. The
    essential elements for consideration are, therefore, (1) the original
    distribution of the metallic materials through the rocks, (2) their
    solution by circulating waters (or, rarely, by other means), (3)
    their transportation in solution to the place of deposit, (4) their
    precipitation in concentrated form, and (5) perhaps their further
    concentration and purification by subsequent processes.</p>

  <p><b>Exceptional and doubtful cases.—</b>There are a few cases where
    ore-deposits are made by volcanic fumes or vapors, but these may
    be neglected here. Formerly, ores were often attributed to vapors
    supposed to arise from the hot interior, but this mode of origin seems
    incompatible with physical conditions. Ores have been attributed to
    water originally contained as steam in lavas, and to waters escaping
    from the interior <span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>of the earth, these waters being supposed to be
    especially mineralized. Direct evidence on this point is obviously
    beyond reach. Segregation in the molten state is recognized as a source
    of ores, but its function is probably confined chiefly to partial
    enrichment as stated below. There are other occasional methods, but the
    chief process of concentration, immeasurably surpassing all others,
    consists in the leaching out of ore materials disseminated through the
    country rock and their redeposition in segregated forms, as an incident
    of the recognized system of water circulation.</p>

  <p><b>Original distribution.—</b>The original distribution of ore
    material through the primitive rocks is beyond the ken of present
    science, for even the nature of the true primitive rocks is unknown.
    For present purposes it is sufficient to regard all rocks concerned
    in ore-deposition as either igneous or sedimentary, and to inquire,
    as a first step, how far ordinary igneous and sedimentary processes
    contribute to the segregation of ore material, leaving for a second
    stage of inquiry the subsequent processes of concentration.</p>

  <p><b>Magmatic segregation.—</b>In a few instances workable masses of ore
    seem to have arisen from lavas by direct segregation in the molten
    state, without the aid of subsequent concentration by water action,
    on which most ores are dependent. It is not improbable that the
    segregation of metallic iron and nickel, and perhaps other metals,
    in the deeper parts of the earth may be a prevalent process, giving
    rise to masses like the native iron found in basalt in Greenland. This
    iron closely resembles the nickel-irons of meteorites, which may be
    illustrations of similar action in small planetary bodies that have
    been disrupted. Metallic masses so segregated presumably gravitate
    toward the planetary center and hence, whatever their inherent
    interest, have little relation to a subject whose basal criterion is
    economic. It is not at all improbable, however, that in the magmatic
    differentiation of the lavas that come to the surface, there is some
    metallic segregation that may make the enriched parts effective
    ground for the concentrating processes of water circulation, and so
    determine the location of ore-deposits. Igneous rocks are not equally
    the seats of ore-deposits, even when the circulatory conditions seem
    to be equally favorable. These conditions may not really be equally
    favorable, but there is good ground to believe that some igneous masses
    constitute a richer field for concentration than others. No definite
    rule, however, for distinguishing rich varieties of rock from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span> lean
    ones has been determined. The basic igneous rocks are, on the whole,
    perhaps somewhat richer in ores than the acidic class, but there is no
    established law. Many acidic rocks bear more and richer ores than many
    basic ones. The view here entertained is that both classes are subject
    to regional enrichment through conditions connected with their origin,
    as yet little known.</p>

  <p><b>Marine segregation and dispersion.—</b>In the formation of the
    sedimentary rocks from the primitive and igneous rocks there was
    notable metallic concentration in some cases, and even more notable
    depletion in others. The ground-waters of the land, after their
    subterranean circuits, carried into the water-basins various metallic
    substances in solution. These were either precipitated early in the
    marine or lacustrine drift of the waters, or became diffused throughout
    the oceanic body. In the main they appear to have been widely diffused,
    and either to have remained long in solution, or to have been very
    sparsely deposited through the marine or lacustrine sediments. As a
    rule, these sediments seem to contain less of valuable ore material
    than igneous rocks, and this is rational, for, as we shall see, the
    ground-water circulation of the land tends to concentrate and hold back
    a part of the metallic content of the land rocks so that only a residue
    reaches the sea. But there are important exceptions to this general
    rule of sedimentary leanness.</p>

  <p>The iron-ore beds of Clinton age ranging from New York to Alabama, and
    appearing also in Wisconsin and Nova Scotia, form a stratum in the
    midst of the ordinary sediments, and contain marine fossils. The great
    ore beds of Lake Superior were originally of similar type, and so are
    most other important iron deposits. It cannot be said, in most cases,
    that these iron deposits are marine as distinguished from lacustrine or
    lodgment deposits, but they are at least sedimentary. The ferruginous
    material was originally disseminated widely through antecedent land
    rocks, but was concentrated in the course of the sedimentary processes.</p>

  <p>Limestone appears to have been sometimes enriched locally in lead and
    zinc, and more rarely in copper, in the course of its sedimentation.
    The lead and zinc regions of the Mississippi basin have been regarded
    as dependent on such regional enrichment as a primary condition. This
    localized enrichment has been attributed to solutions brought into the
    sea from neighboring metal-bearing lands and precipitated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span> organic
    action in the sea-water,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> this organic action being more effective
    in some areas than in others because of the unequal distribution of
    life and the concentration of its decaying products. It is assumed
    that such precipitates were at first too diffuse to be of value, and
    further concentration was required to bring them together into workable
    deposits; but the further processes appear to have been effective only
    where the preliminary enrichment had taken place. At any rate, the
    workable deposits are singularly localized, while the concentrative
    processes are very general.</p>

  <p>Metallic material is sometimes partially concentrated in sandstones
    and shales in the process of sedimentation, though more rarely. The
    copper-bearing shale (Kupferschiefer) of the Zechstein group in
    Germany, so extensively worked along the flanks of the Harz Mountains,
    is a striking example.</p>

  <p>It is in every way reasonable to suppose that land-waters, on reaching
    the margins of the water-basins, must occasionally find conditions
    favorable for the precipitation of their metallic contents, and that
    the ratio of these precipitates to other material might be relatively
    high in the more favorable situations, and that this enrichment of the
    country rock may be a condition precedent to a sufficient subsequent
    concentration to yield workable accumulations.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, inferred that while the processes of sedimentation
    tended on the whole to leanness, they gave rise to (1) some very
    important ore-deposits, notably the chief iron ores, the greatest of
    all ores in quantity and in real industrial value, and (2) a diffuse
    enrichment of certain other areas which made them productive under
    subsequent concentrative processes, while the sedimentary formations in
    general were left barren.</p>

  <p><b>Origin of ore regions.—</b>From these considerations it appears that
    for the fundamental explanation of “mining regions” we must look mainly
    (1) to magmatic differentiation, so far as the country rock is igneous,
    and (2) to sedimentary enrichment, so far as the rock is secondary. The
    determining conditions in both cases are obscure and unpredictable, but
    the recognition of such regions, and of the function of preliminary
    diffuse regional enrichment, contributes to a comprehensive view of
    the complex processes of ore concentration. The subsequent processes
    consist in the further concentration of the ore material <span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>into sheets,
    lodes, veins, and similar aggregations by ground-water circulation,
    or else in the purification of the ores by the removal of useless or
    deleterious material, or in both combined.</p>

  <p><b>Surface residual concentration.—</b>The simplest of all modes of
    concentration takes place in the formation of mantle-rock. An insoluble
    or slightly soluble metallic substance sparsely distributed through a
    rock may be concentrated to working value by the decay and removal of
    the main rock material, leaving the metallic material in the residuary
    mantle. The tin ores of the Malay peninsula<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> are especially good
    examples. The crystals of tin oxide were originally scattered sparsely
    through granite and limestone, but by their decay and partial removal
    it has accumulated in workable quantities. Certain gold fields and
    certain iron ores have acquired higher values in the same way. Such
    residuary material may be further concentrated by wash into gulches
    or alluvial flats, in the course of which the lighter parts of the
    mantle-rock are largely carried away, and the heavier, including the
    metal or its compounds, are mainly left behind. Gold placers are the
    best example. The mining of placers by hydraulic processes is but a
    further extension of the natural process of concentration.</p>

  <p>Such concentrates in past ages have in some cases been buried by later
    deposits, and hence certain ancient sandstones, conglomerates, and
    mantle-rocks have become ore-bearing horizons. The Rand of South Africa
    appears to be of this type.</p>

  <p><b>Purification and concentration.—</b>A somewhat different mode of
    concentration and purification has affected certain of the great iron
    deposits. As already explained, the iron compounds were originally
    dissolved from the iron-bearing constituents of the primitive or of
    igneous rocks, or their derivatives, and were deposited in beds as
    chemical stratiform deposits. In some cases they were sufficiently
    pure, as first precipitated, to be worked profitably, but in most cases
    they were seriously affected by undesirable mineral associates. When,
    however, such impure deposits are subjected for long periods to the
    percolation of waters from the surface under favorable conditions,
    the impurities are often dissolved and the ores concentrated. The
    great Bessemer ore-deposits of Lake Superior are examples. Originally
    impure carbonates or silicates, they have been converted into rich and
    phenomenally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span> pure ferric oxides along certain lines of ground-water
    circulation, and in certain areas of free leaching. Van Hise has shown
    the definite relation between the water circulation and the production
    of the high-grade ores.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Vast quantities of unconcentrated lean
    ores lie in the tracts not thus purified and enriched by circulating
    waters. This does not appear to be simply residual concentration. The
    waters seem to have added ferric oxide brought from above, while they
    carried away the “impurities,” silica, carbon dioxide, etc. Perhaps
    this is an instance of mass action in which the ore present aided in
    causing additions to itself.</p>

  <p><b>Concentration by solution and reprecipitation.—</b>By a process
    almost the opposite of residual concentration, ore material is often
    leached out of the surface-rock by water circulating slowly through
    its pores, cleavage planes, and minute crevices, and is carried on
    with the circulation until it reaches some substance which causes a
    reaction that precipitates the ore material. This substance may be a
    constituent of some rock which the circulating water encounters, such
    as organic matter. More commonly, the precipitation seems to be due
    to the mingling of waters charged with different mineral substances,
    the mingling inducing reaction and the precipitation of the ore.
    Precipitation, however, does not necessarily follow such commingling.
    The junctions of underground waterways are sometimes characterized by
    barrenness instead of richness. In the expressive phraseology of the
    miners, a tributary current sometimes “makes” and sometimes “cuts out.”
    In chemical phrase, when the mingling waters reduce the solubility
    of the appropriate substance sufficiently, an ore-deposit is formed;
    when they increase its solubility, they promote barrenness. Changes of
    pressure and temperature may enter into the process, and mass action
    may lend its aid when once a deposit is started.</p>

  <p>More concretely stated, the general process of underground ore
    formation appears to be this: the permeating waters dissolve the ore
    material disseminated through the rock and carry it thence into the
    main channels of circulation, usually the fissures, broken tracts,
    porous belts, or cavernous spaces. If precipitating conditions are
    found there, deposition takes place. The precipitating conditions
    may be merely changes of physical state, such as cooling or relief
    of pressure, but probably much more generally they consist in the
    commingling and mutual reaction of waters that have pursued different
    courses and become differently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span> mineralized, as implied above. In these
    cases the metal-bearing current may be scarcely more important than the
    precipitating current.</p>

  <p>Since the solvent action is a condition precedent to deposition, the
    location of the greatest solvent action first invites attention. At
    present it must be treated in general terms, for it is not known what
    solutions must be formed beyond the fact that they must include the
    ore material. Probably they must include much besides. Furthermore,
    it is not known that deep-seated rocks carry more ore material than
    similar rocks at or near the surface or at any other horizon. Fantastic
    conceptions of deep-seated metallic richness are to be shunned as quite
    beyond practical consideration. The water circulation is probably very
    slight below a depth of two or three miles at most, and above that
    depth there is little ground to suppose that the rocks of one horizon
    are inherently more metalliferous than others of their kind. There is
    no assignable reason why the igneous rocks at the surface are not as
    rich in ore material as the igneous rocks two or three miles below,
    since all are probably eruptive and of much the same nature on the
    whole, being in many cases parts of the same eruptions.</p>

  <p><b>Location of greatest solvent action.—</b>Solvent action is
    probably most <i>intense</i> where the temperature and pressure are
    highest, that is, in the deeper reaches of water circulation; but the
    <i>amount</i> of water passing in and out of the deeper zone is but
    a small fraction of that which courses through the upper horizons,
    and the total solvent action is quite certainly much greater in the
    upper zone than in the lower. At the same time the solutions in the
    upper zone are quite certainly more dilute than those below. The
    horizon of greatest solution lies between the surface and a level
    slightly below the ground-water surface, or, in other words, in the
    zone where atmosphere and hydrosphere coöperate. Surface-waters are
    charged with atmospheric and organic acids and other solvents, and
    their general effect upon the rocks is markedly solvent down to or
    often below the permanent water-level. In this zone concentration by
    residual accumulation may take place, as already noted, if the metallic
    compounds resist solution; otherwise this zone is depleted of its ore
    material by solution, and preparation is made for deposition elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Solution also continues to take place varyingly as the water descends
    below this zone of dominant solution, and extends probably to the full
    depth of water circulation, but in the deeper circuit, precipitation
    also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span> takes place and the action becomes complex. With the waters
    taking up and throwing down material at the same time, it is difficult
    to estimate the balance of results.</p>

  <p>When waters that have been mineralized near the surface descend, they
    often take on a precipitating phase at no great depth below the upper
    level of the ground-water; thus sulphides that were oxidized and
    dissolved near the surface are reprecipitated, often at horizons not
    greatly below the permanent water-level. Waters that dissolve metallic
    substances in the upper levels often become charged with sulphuretted
    hydrogen and other precipitants within a few scores or a few hundreds
    of feet of the surface, as deep wells abundantly prove. The freshness
    of surface which metallic sulphides often exhibit at these levels is
    fair ground for inferring recency of deposition and absence of solvent
    action. Actual demonstrations of depositions in progress are not
    wanting.</p>

  <p><b>Short-course action.—</b>The concentration which thus takes place
    by solution in the upper zone, followed closely by reprecipitation
    within a few score or a few hundred feet, may well be termed the
    <i>short-course mode</i> of ore concentration. It finds its most
    important illustration in what is commonly known as the “secondary
    enrichment” of ore-deposits. The ores in the outcropping edge of the
    vein or lode are dissolved by the surface-waters, carried a short
    distance down the ore tract and redeposited, causing enrichment at that
    point. This is only a special case of what takes place generally at
    this horizon. It is effective in this case because it has a previous
    partial concentration to work upon. Secondary enrichments of this
    kind often contain most or all the workable values of the ore tract.
    If instead of a previous concentration in a vein, lode, or similar
    ore tract, there had been partial concentration in the country rock
    by sedimentation, as in the case of iron-ore beds and perhaps lead-,
    zinc-, and copper-impregnated sediments, the short-course method
    may give working values not before possessed. In some of the more
    obscure cases of previous partial concentration in the crystalline and
    other rocks, it is probably this short-course action that brings the
    concentration up to working value. It is probably effective also in
    concentrating the metallic contents of certain igneous rocks that were
    rich in metallic material when extruded. How far this is true has been,
    and still remains, a mooted question.</p>

  <p><b>Long-course action.—</b>After the surface-waters have once passed
    through a cycle of dissolving and precipitating action, as they are apt
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span> do within the first few hundred feet of their courses below the
    water-level, they are liable to pass through a succession of dissolving
    and depositing stages, each reaction resulting in a state that makes
    a new reaction possible. This is especially true if the waters pursue
    deep courses. Strictly speaking, the precipitations usually concern
    only a part of the substances dissolved. New substances are often
    taken up in the very act of throwing down those already held, and the
    way thus prepared for further changes. If the water pursues a deep
    and devious course, it may receive additions by solution and suffer
    losses by precipitation at many points in its course, both descending
    and ascending. The changes are very complex, and in the case of a deep
    or long circuit where various rocks, pressures, and temperatures are
    encountered, the history becomes one long succession of complexities,
    the full nature of which is not yet revealed.</p>

  <p>In the deeper circuits, each individual current usually takes on a
    descending, a lateral, and ascending phase, the three being necessary
    to complete a circuit. The chemical conditions of the waters in the
    three phases are probably not sharply distinguished from one another,
    and hence there seems to be no defined horizon of concentration
    comparable to that near the water-level already described. The chief
    distinctions in the deeper regions relate to pressure, temperature,
    length or depth of penetration, and duration of contact. It seems safe
    to assume, as a general truth, that, other things being equal, the
    solutions become more complex and more nearly reach general saturation
    the farther and the deeper the waters penetrate.</p>

  <p>It has long been a mooted question whether ore-deposits are due chiefly
    to descending, to lateral, or to ascending currents. The question in
    its usual form is too undiscriminating for advantageous discussion, but
    if the ore-deposits due to surface or short-course concentrations and
    reconcentrations be set aside, as in some sense a separate class, the
    relative functions of the descending, the lateral, and the ascending
    portions of the deeper circulations become a measurably definite
    question. Two great working factors enter into the comparison: (1) much
    greater circulation in the upper zone, where lateral movement most
    prevails; (2) much greater heat and pressure in the lower zone, where
    the circulation must be chiefly vertical.</p>

  <p>Heat and pressure in general favor solution, and hence so far as this
    factor goes, descending water is likely to be increasing its mineral
    content,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span> rather than diminishing it by deposition. But this is
    only general; particular elements of the solution may be deposited.
    In ascending, as the same water must later, it is predisposed to
    deposition from loss of solvent power through reduction of pressure
    and temperature. The theoretical balance is here clearly in favor
    of preponderant deposition by the ascending portion of the current.
    So far as precipitation is dependent on the mingling of differently
    mineralized waters, descending and ascending currents seem to be
    situated much alike, in general, for both are subject to accessions and
    mutual unions.</p>

  <p>The amount of water that circulates in the deeper horizons is much less
    than that nearer the surface. Allowing a few hundred, or at most one
    or two thousand feet for the special short-circuit zone next below the
    water-level (it is known to reach 1000 to 1500 feet in some cases),
    the water circulating through the next 1000 or 2000 feet is probably
    several times greater than all that circulates at greater depths, and
    this greater circulation above doubtless offsets, in greater or less
    measure, the intensified action of the deeper circulation. Much of the
    upper and more rapid circulation is lateral, being actuated by the
    sloping surface of the ground-water, which in turn is determined by
    topography, precipitation, and other surface conditions. Theoretical
    considerations, therefore, favor the view that lateral flow is
    an important factor in the concentration of ore material. But as
    descending and lateral currents almost inevitably meet and mingle
    with ascending currents, it is difficult to distinguish, in the
    ore-deposits, the special functions of each phase of action. It is even
    more difficult to determine whether the different phases are not alike
    essential to the mutual reactions on which the deposition depends.
    It may be as necessary to have a precipitant as to have a metallic
    constituent in solution to be precipitated, and what is more, this
    precipitating agency may be a substance of no economic value in itself
    and of no obvious relations to the substances that form the ores. If
    the deposition is due solely to a physical state, as relief of pressure
    or lowering of temperature, these considerations do not hold.</p>

  <p><b>Summary.—</b>The general results are probably these: In the deeper
    circuits, more ore material is brought upward and deposited than is
    carried downward and deposited, so that metallic values are shifted
    toward accessible horizons. In the lateral currents, more metallic
    values are shifted toward the trunk-lines of circulation—the great
    crevices and other waterways—than are carried from these into the rock
    and distributed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span> and lateral segregation results. At the same time
    the atmospheric waters acting at or near the surface concentrate ore
    values downwards. <i>The sum total of these processes is to promote the
    development of the higher ore values in accessible horizons, and along
    the main lines of circulation.</i></p>

  <p><b>The influence of contacts.—</b>As ore-deposits depend on a
    dissolving state followed by a depositing state of the waters, and
    perhaps on a complex succession of these alterations, it is obvious
    that conditions which favor changes of state and the commingling of
    different kinds of water are apt to be favorable to ore production.
    At any rate it is observed that many important ore-deposits occur at
    the contact between formations of different character. The contact
    of igneous rock with limestone is a rather notable instance. It is
    not to be inferred that such contacts are generally accompanied by
    workable ore-deposits, but merely that a notable proportion of workable
    ore-deposits occur at such junctions. It is rational to suppose that
    where the chemical nature of the two formations is in contrast, the
    waters that percolate through the one are likely to be mineralized very
    differently from those that course through the other, and hence that on
    mingling at the contact, reactions are specially liable to take place,
    and that when a valuable metallic substance is present it is liable to
    be involved and by chance to suffer precipitation. Reactions are the
    more probable because the contact is likely to be a plane of crustal
    movement, and hence more or less open and accompanied by fractures,
    zones of crushed rock and other conditions that facilitate circulation
    and offer suitable places for ore formation.</p>

  <p><b>The effect of igneous intrusions.—</b>A special case of much
    importance arises when lavas are intruded into sediments that have
    previously been partially enriched in the ways above described.
    The igneous intrusion not only introduces new contact zones, and
    more or less fracturing, but it brings into play hot waters with
    their intensified solvent work, their more active circulation, and
    the reaction between waters of different temperatures. The special
    efficiency of these agencies is believed to be the determining factor
    in many cases.</p>

  <p><b>The influence of rock walls.—</b>The rock walls themselves are
    thought sometimes to be a factor in ore-precipitating reactions. By
    mass action, they may withdraw a constituent of the solution and
    destroy its equilibrium in such a way as to cause the precipitation of
    the metallic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span> constituent. Once deposited on the walls ores aid, by
    mass action, the further accretion of ores.</p>

  <p>The special forms which ores assume in deposition, as beds, veins,
    lodes, stockworks, disseminations, segregations, etc., are chiefly
    incidental to the local situation in which the essential chemical or
    physical change takes place.</p>

  <p><b>The structural phases which rocks assume.—</b>In the previous
    chapters, the general method by which rocks are formed has been set
    forth, and many of their structural features have been touched upon
    incidentally. It remains to assemble the structural features already
    mentioned, and to consider certain additional structural phases which
    rocks assume.</p>

  <h3>STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.</h3>

  <p>In the deposition of sediments in the sea, or in other bodies of
    standing water, the coarser portion of the material is usually
    deposited in the shallow water near the shore where the wave-action
    is strongest, and the less coarse of various grades is deposited at
    greater and greater distances from the land, while only extremely
    fine silt is usually carried out to abysmal depths (see <a href="#Page_380"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 380</a>). To
    this general law of distribution there are important exceptions. Fine
    sediments are sometimes deposited near the shore, and where currents,
    tidal agitation, or floating ice are effective, coarse deposits are
    occasionally carried far out from the shore.</p>

  <p><b>Stratification.—</b>Sedimentary rocks are usually arranged in more
    or less distinct layers; that is, they are <i>stratified</i>. The
    stratification consists primarily in the superposition of layers of
    different constitution or different compactness on one another. Layers
    of like constitution or compactness are often separated by films of
    different material which cause the partings between them. The bedded
    arrangement of stratified rocks is due to various causes, but primarily
    to the varying agitation of the waters in which the sediment was laid
    down. Where the depositing waters are agitated to the bottom, coarse
    sediment is likely to be deposited. Where the waters are quiet at
    the bottom, fine sediment is the rule. Since the agitation of the
    waters is subject to frequent change, it follows that coarser material
    succeeds finer, and finer coarser, in the same place. Hence arise
    <i>beds</i>, <i>layers</i>, and <i>laminæ</i>. The terms <i>layer</i>
    and <i>bed</i> are generally used as synonyms, while <i>laminæ</i> are
    thinner divisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span> of the same sort. The term stratum is sometimes
    applied to one layer and sometimes to all the consecutive layers of the
    same sort of rock. For the latter meaning the term <i>formation</i> is
    often used. Sometimes bedding seems to have been determined by strong
    currents which temporarily not only prevented deposition over a given
    area, but even cut away the loose surface of deposits already made,
    giving a firm surface from which succeeding deposits are distinct. This
    sequence of events is sometimes shown by the truncation of laminæ,
    and by other signs of erosion. The commoner sorts of bedded rock are
    limestones, shales, sandstones, and conglomerates.</p>

  <p>The bedding of <i>limestones</i> is often caused by the introduction
    of thin films of clayey material which interrupt the continuity of
    the lime accumulation and cause natural partings. Sometimes, however,
    bedding arises from variations in the physical condition of the
    lime sediment itself. Lamination is not usually conspicuous in pure
    limestone, though it may be well developed in the shaly phases of
    this rock. <i>Shales</i> are normally laminated as well as bedded,
    and the lamination is often more notable than the thicker bedding.
    Bedding in shale may arise from the introduction of sandy laminæ, or
    by notable changes in the texture of the shale material. Similarly,
    <i>sandstones</i> are sometimes divided into beds by shaly (clayey)
    partings, but more often by variations in the coarseness of the sand
    itself, or by the presence of laminæ that are less coherent than those
    above and below. Sometimes the layers appear to be determined by the
    compacting of the surface of sand already accumulated before it was
    buried by later deposits. Sandstones may be thick- or thin-bedded, and
    their bedding passes insensibly into lamination.</p>

  <p>Sand deposits usually take place in relatively shallow water, and
    the sand is subjected to much shifting before it finds a permanent
    lodgment. In the course of this shifting, bars are formed which
    usually have a rather steep face in the direction in which they
    are being shifted. The sand carried over the top of the bar finds
    lodgment on the sloping terrace face. The inclined laminæ thus formed
    constitute a kind of bedding, but since its planes do not conform to
    the general horizontal attitude of the formation as a whole, it is
    called <i>false-</i> or <i>cross-bedding</i> or, more accurately,
    <i>cross-lamination</i> (see <a href="#fig368"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 368</a>). The same structure is developed
    on delta fronts and generally in water shallow enough to be subject
    to frequent agitation at the bottom. Sandstone is cross-bedded more
    commonly than other sorts of sedimentary rock.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span></p>

  <p>The bedding of <i>conglomerate</i> is due chiefly to variations in
    coarseness. Laminæ or thicker layers of sand are frequently found
    between layers of coarser material. Conglomerate is likely to be
    thick-bedded, and cross-bedding is common.</p>

  <p><b>Lateral gradation.—</b>When the varying nature of the agitation
    of the sea at different depths and along the different parts of the
    coast-border, and during different phases of the sea-currents, is
    considered, it will be readily understood that sedimentary beds are
    affected by many irregularities, and that deposits of one kind grade
    into others horizontally with great freedom. Thus a bed of conglomerate
    (gravel) may grade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span> laterally into sandstone, and this into shale or
    limestone. It is indeed rather more remarkable that the sedimentary
    strata should be as regular and persistent as they are, than that they
    sometimes grade into one another.</p>

  <p><b>Special markings.—</b>The rhythmical action of waves gives rise to
    undulatory lodgment, known as <i>ripple-marks</i> (<a href="#fig324"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 324</a>). They are
    usually not the direct product of the surface-waves, since they are
    much too small. They are produced mainly by the vibratory movement of
    the undertow, but they apparently result from various other phases of
    vibratory agitation of the bottom waters. They are sometimes made by
    streams and stream-like currents. Ripple-marks are apparently preserved
    indefinitely under proper circumstances. They are sometimes found, for
    example, on very ancient quartzites. Ripples are also made by wind
    (<a href="#Page_37"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 37</a>). Ripple-marks are usually only an inch or two from crest to
    crest, but in rare instances they attain much greater size. Examples
    of ripple-marks 30 feet across are known.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Occasional ridges
    and depressions of much greater dimensions are produced which are
    attributable to the formation of successive bars, or to the building of
    wave-cusps.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> <i>Rill-marks</i> are not infrequently produced by the
    undertow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span> and other currents passing over pebbles, shells, etc. (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>

  <p>Sediments are sometimes exposed between tides, or under other
    circumstances, for periods long enough to permit drying and cracking
    at the surface. On the return of the waters, the cracks may be filled
    and permanently preserved. These are known as <i>sun-cracks</i> or
    <i>mud-cracks</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig328">328</a> and <a href="#fig369">369</a>). They chiefly affect shales,
    but are occasionally seen in limestones and fine-grained sandstones.
    During the exposure of the sediments a shower may pass and <i>rain-drop
      impressions</i> (<a href="#fig370"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 370</a>) be made which are subsequently filled
    by fine sediment and preserved. The size and depth of rain-drop
    impressions give some hint as to the meteorological conditions of
    far-off ages. <i>Wave-marks</i>, which consist of the faint line-ridges
    developed on a sandy beach at the limit of the incoming wave, are
    sometimes preserved and may be seen occasionally on layers of rock
    deposited millions of years ago.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Concretionary structure.—</b>Various sedimentary formations
    contain nodules or irregularly shaped masses of mineral matter unlike
    the rock in which they occur. When these nodules consist of matter
    aggregated about some center, they are called <i>concretions</i>.
    They are common in sedimentary rocks, and here it may sometimes be
    seen that the aggregation has taken place about a shell, a leaf,
    or some other organic relic. The nuclei are, however, not always
    organic. The material of the concretion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span> may have come from the
    immediately surrounding rock, having been first dissolved by water
    and then deposited about the nucleus, or it may have been introduced
    from without, likewise by the agency of water. In the first case,
    the mineral matter of the concretion is usually one of the minor
    constituents of the rock. Thus the commonest concretions in limestone
    are composed of impure silica (chert, <a href="#fig361"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 361</a>); in shale, of lime
    carbonate or iron sulphide; in sandstone, of iron oxide. The concretion
    may be made up almost wholly of concentrated matter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span> in which case
    the matter originally in the place of the concretion has been crowded
    aside; or it may involve much of the material of the imbedding rock.
    Thus the concretion of lime carbonate in shale may be nearly pure,
    or it may involve much of the earthy matter of the shale, while the
    concretion of iron oxide in sandstone commonly includes much sand. In
    extreme cases, indeed, the concentrated matter of the concretion merely
    cements the material involved into distinct nodules. Occasionally the
    rock substance itself takes on a concretionary form, all or most of its
    material being involved.</p>

  <p>In size, concretions may vary from microscopic dimensions to huge
    masses, 8, 10, or even more feet in diameter. The variations in shape
    are also great. They may be spherical, elliptical, discoid, or they
    may assume more irregular and complex forms (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig371">371</a> and <a href="#fig372">372</a>). The
    conditions of growth have much to do with the form. Thus a concretion
    which starts as a sphere may find growth easier in one plane than
    another, when it becomes discoid. Two or more concretions sometimes
    grow together, giving rise to complicated forms. Some of the most
    complex and fantastic forms are perhaps to be explained in this way.
    Concretions sometimes take the form of tubes. Some minute tubular
    concretions were formed about rootlets, but the larger ones appear to
    owe their form to other influences (<a href="#fig374"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 374</a>).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span></p>

  <p>One of the most extraordinary features of some concretions of complex
    form is their symmetry. This may be of various phases; in exceptional
    cases there is a bilateral symmetry almost as perfect as in the higher
    types of animals. This is especially true of certain calcareous
    concretions developed in plastic clays (<a href="#fig373"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 373</a>).</p>

    the east base of the Rocky Mountains in Montana. (Photo. by Church.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Concretions sometimes develop cracks within themselves, and these may
    then be filled with mineral matter differing in composition or color
    from that of the original concretions (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig375">375</a> and <a href="#fig376">376</a>). Concretions
    the cracks of which have been filled by deposition from solution, are
    called <i>septaria</i>. They are especially abundant in some of the
    Cretaceous shales and clays. In not a few cases the filling of the
    cracks appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span> to have wedged segments of the original concretion
    farther and farther apart, until the outer surface of the septarium is
    made up more largely of vein-matter than of the original concretion
    (<a href="#fig377"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 377</a>). Such concretions are often popularly known as “petrified
    turtles.”</p>

  <p>Concretions of the sort indicated above often develop after the
    enclosing sedimentary rock was deposited. This is shown, among other
    things, by the fact that numerous planes of lamination may sometimes be
    traced through the concretions.</p>

  <p>Concretions also form in water during the deposition of sedimentary
    rock. Exceptionally, sedimentary rock is made up chiefly of
    concretions. The chemical precipitates from the concentrated waters
    of certain enclosed lakes sometimes take the form of minute spherules
    which resemble the roe of fish. From this resemblance the resulting
    rock is called <i>oolite</i> (<a href="#fig357"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 357</a>). Oolite is now forming about
    some coral reefs, presumably from the precipitation of the lime
    carbonate which was temporarily in solution. Considerable beds of
    limestone are sometimes oolitic. The calcium carbonate of such rock may
    be subsequently replaced by silica, so that the oolitic structure is
    sometimes found in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span> silicious rock. If the concretions become larger,
    say as large as peas, the rock is called <i>pisolite</i> instead of
    oolite (<a href="#fig378"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 378</a>).</p>

  <p>Beds of iron ore are likewise sometimes concretionary. Thus in the
    Clinton formation there are widespread beds of “flaxseed” ore made up
    of concretions of iron oxide which, individually, resemble the seed
    which has given the ore its name. The nucleus in this case is usually
    too small for identification.</p>

  <p><b>Secretions.—</b>When cavities in rock are filled by material
    deposited from solution, the result is sometimes called a
    <i>secretion</i>. Secretions therefore grow from without toward a
    center, while concretions follow the opposite order. Crystal-lined
    cavities (<i>geodes</i>, <a href="#fig359"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 359</a>) and agates (<a href="#fig358"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 358</a>) are examples
    of secretions. Crystal-lined cavities and veins are the same in
    principle.</p>

  <h3>STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF IGNEOUS ROCKS.</h3>

  <p>Certain structural features of igneous rocks have been mentioned in
    treating of their origin in the previous chapter. When a great flow
    of lava spreads out upon the surface, there is no internal lamination
    or stratification, and the resulting rock is usually classified as
    massive rather than stratified; but when a succession of flows occur,
    each individual flow forms a layer, and the series as a whole becomes
    stratiform.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span> The successive flows are not usually coextensive. If the
    later flows of the closing stages of a period of vulcanism fail to
    reach as far as the earlier ones, a terraced or step-like aspect is
    given to the region, whence the name <i>trap-rock</i> (<i>trappe</i>,
    steps) is derived. Such lava sheets, especially if of basalt, often
    assume a <i>columnar</i> structure in cooling, the columns being rude
    six-sided prisms standing at right angles to the cooling surfaces
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig379">379</a> and <a href="#fig380">380</a>). This phenomenon is usually best developed where
    the sheet is intruded between layers of preexisting rock in the form of
    sills. The formation of the columns is sometimes regarded as a variety
    of concretionary action, but more commonly as a result of contraction.
    The former is suggested by the ball-and-socket ends of the sections of
    some columns (<a href="#fig382"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 382</a>). The development of the columns by contraction
    may be explained as follows: The surface of the homogeneous lava
    contracts about equally in all directions on cooling. The contractile
    force may be thought of as centering about equidistant points. About a
    given point, the least number of cracks which will relieve the tension
    in all directions is three (<a href="#fig383"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 383</a>). If these radiate symmetrically
    from the point, the angle between any two is 120°, the angle of the
    hexagonal prism. Similar radiating cracks from other centers complete
    the columns (<a href="#fig384"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 384</a>). A five-sided column would arise from the
    failure of the cracks to develop about some one of the points (<a href="#fig385"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    385</a>).</p>

    Yellowstone Park. (Iddings, <abbr title="United States Geological Survey">U.&nbsp;S. Geol. Surv.</abbr>)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>When lava is forced into crevices or rises to the surface through
    fissures, and the residual portion solidifies in them, it gives rise
    to <i>dikes</i>, as illustrated in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig002">2</a> and <a href="#fig417">417</a> (not a true dike).
    Dikes are sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span> affected by columnar structure. In this case, as
    in all others, the columns are likely to be at right angles to the
    cooling surface. Lava solidifying in the passageway leading from the
    interior of a volcano gives rise to a <i>neck</i> or <i>plug</i>. If
    the lava is forced between beds of rock in the form of a sheet, and
    solidifies there, it is called a <i>sill</i>. If, after rising to a
    certain point in the strata, the lava arches the beds above into a
    dome, and forms a great lens-like or cistern-like mass, it constitutes
    a <i>laccolith</i> (<a href="#fig334"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 334</a>). If an intrusion of the laccolithic type
    faults the overlying beds instead of arching them, and especially if
    the vertical dimension of the intruded mass be great in comparison with
    its lateral dimensions, its shape is more like that of a plug or core.
    Such an intruded core is a <i>bysmalith</i><a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> (<a href="#fig124"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 124</a>). Between
    the bysmalith and the laccolith there are various gradations, just as
    between the laccolith and the sill. When lava forces aside the rocks at
    considerable depths or absorbs them by solution or by “stoping,” and
    then solidifies in great masses of irregular or undetermined forms,
    these masses are called <i>batholiths</i>.</p>

  <h3>STRUCTURAL FEATURES ARISING FROM DISTURBANCE.</h3>

  <p><b>Inclination and folding of strata.—</b>The original attitude
    of beds, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>whether formed by water or by lava-flows, is normally
    horizontal, or nearly so. Both kinds of deposits, however, occasionally
    take place on considerable slopes. Modifications of the original
    attitude result from earth movements, and the measurement of these
    modifications is an important feature of field study. It is recorded
    in terms of <i>dip</i> and <i>strike</i>. The dip is the inclination
    of the beds referred to a horizontal plane, as illustrated in <a href="#fig386"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    386</a>, and is usually measured by a clinometer, the principle of which
    is shown in <a href="#fig387"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 387</a>. In measuring the dip, the maximum angle is
    always taken. In <a href="#fig386"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 386</a>, for example, the angle would be less if
    the direction were either to the right or left of that indicated by
    the arrow. The direction as well as the amount of the dip is always
    to be noted. This must be determined by the compass, to which the
    clinometer may be conveniently attached. Dip 40°, S. 20° W. gives the
    full record of the position of the bed of rock under consideration.
    The strike is the direction of the horizontal edge of dipping beds, or
    more generally, the direction of a horizontal line on the surface of
    the beds. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig386"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 386</a>. Since the strike is always
    at right angles to the dip, the strike need not be recorded if the
    direction of the dip is. Thus dip 40°, S. 20° W. is the same as dip
    40°, strike N. 70° W.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span></p>

  <p>When the beds incline in a single direction, they form a
    <i>monocline</i>. When beds are arched so as to incline away from
    one another, they form an up-fold or <i>anticline</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig388">388</a> to
    <a href="#fig391">391</a>). The anticline may depart from its simple form, as shown in
    <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig390">390</a> and <a href="#fig391">391</a>. When beds are curved downward so as to incline
    towards one another, they form a <i>syncline</i> (<a href="#fig392"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 392</a>). When
    beds assume the position shown in <a href="#fig393"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 393</a>, the folds are said to be
    <i>isoclinal</i>. When they are arched so as to form a cone or dome,
    and incline in all directions from a central point, they are said to
    have a <i>quaquaversal</i> dip. When considerable tracts are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span> bent so
    as to form great arches or great troughs with many minor undulations on
    the flanks of the larger, they are designated as <i>geanticlines</i>,
    or <i>anticlinoria</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig394">394</a> and <a href="#fig395">395</a>), and <i>geosynclines</i> or

  <p>As found in the field, folds are usually much eroded, and often
    completely truncated (<a href="#fig398"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 398</a>). The determination of anticlinal or
    synclinal structure is then not based on topography, or even on such
    sections as shown in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig394">394</a> to <a href="#fig397">397</a>, for such sections are relatively
    rare. The structure is determined by a careful record of dips and
    strikes. On the field map, the record may be made as shown in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr>
    <a href="#fig399">399</a> to <a href="#fig401">401</a>, where the free ends of the lines with but one free end
    point in the direction of dip, while the other lines represent the
    directions of strike. Applying this method, the structure shown in
    <a href="#fig400"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 400</a> represents a syncline, and that in <a href="#fig401"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 401</a> an anticline. In

  <p>Much the larger portion of the earth’s surface is occupied by beds that
    retain nearly their original horizontal attitude; but in mountainous
    regions the beds have usually suffered bending, folding, crumpling, and
    crushing, in various degrees, in the course of the deformations that
    gave rise to the mountains. Distortion is on the whole most intense
    and characteristic in the most ancient rocks known, the Archean, in
    which a distorted condition is nearly universal, so far as observation
    goes. Distortion is assigned chiefly to lateral thrust arising from
    the shrinkage of the earth, as explained in the chapter on Earth
    Movements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span> The simpler, and some rather complex forms of deformation,
    are shown in the preceding figures, but the folding is sometimes much
    more complex (<a href="#fig406"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 406</a>), the folds sometimes “fan” (<a href="#fig407"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 407</a>), and the
    beds of which they are composed are sometimes intricately crumpled
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig408">408</a> to <a href="#fig410">410</a>). Among these various phases of deformation there are
    all gradations and combinations. Overturned folds reverse the order of
    the strata in the under limb of the fold. After such folds have been
    greatly eroded, so that their outer form is lost and their relations
    have become obscure, the reversed beds are likely to be interpreted as
    though they lay in natural order. In such a case as that represented in
    <a href="#fig411"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 411</a>, a complex structure may be interpreted as a simple one. Thus
    the strata of <a href="#fig411"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 411</a> may have the structure shown in
    <a href="#fig412"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 412</a>, <a href="#fig413">413</a>,
    or <a href="#fig414">414</a>, so far as dip and strike show.</p>

  <p><b>Joints.—</b>The surface rocks of the earth are almost universally
    traversed by deep cracks called <i>joints</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig415">415</a>, <a href="#fig138">138</a> and
    <a href="#fig140">140</a>). In most regions there are at least two systems of joints, the
    crevices of each system being roughly parallel to one another, while
    those of the two systems, where there are two, are approximately at
    right angles. In regions of great disturbance, the number of sets of
    joints is often three, four, or even more. The joints of each set may
    be many yards apart, or in exceptional cases, but a few inches, or even
    a fraction of an inch.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, there are more systems of joints, and more
    frequent joints in each system, where the rocks are much deformed than
    where they have been but little disturbed. In undisturbed rocks the
    joints approach verticality, but in regions where the rocks have been
    notably deformed, the joint planes may have any position. Not rarely
    they simulate bedding planes, especially in igneous and metamorphic
    rocks (<a href="#fig416"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 416</a>). In the latter case especially, the cleavage due to
    jointing is often mistaken for bedding. They do not ordinarily show
    themselves at the surface in regions where there is much mantle rock,
    but they are readily seen in the faces of cliffs, in quarries, and,
    in general, wherever rock is exposed (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig138">138</a> and <a href="#fig140">140</a>). Though some
    of them extend to greater depths than rock has ever been penetrated,
    joints are, after all, superficial phenomena. They must be limited to
    the zone of fracture, and most of them are probably much more narrowly
    limited. Joints frequently end at the plane of contact of two sorts
    of rock. Thus a joint extending down through limestone may end where
    shale is reached.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span> Joints are frequently offset at the contact of
    layers or formations, and a single joint sometimes gives place to many
    smaller ones. All these phenomena are to be explained on the basis of
    the different constitution and elasticity of various sorts of rock.
    Generally speaking, rigid rock is more readily jointed than that which
    is more yielding.</p>

  <p>Joints may remain closed, or they may gap. In the latter case, they may
    be widened by solution, weathering, etc., but they are quite as likely
    to be filled by detritus from above, or by material deposited from
    solution (veins). It is along joint-planes that many rich ore-veins are
    developed (<a href="#Page_478"><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 478–484</a>).</p>

  <p>Joints have been referred to various causes, among which tension,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
    torsion,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> earthquakes,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> and shearing<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> are the most
    important. Most of them may probably be referred to the tension or
    compression developed during crustal movements.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In the formation
    of a simple fold, for example, tension-joints parallel with the fold
    will be developed, if tension goes beyond the limit of elasticity
    of the rock involved. If the axis of a fold is not horizontal, that
    is, if it “plunges,” as it commonly does, a second set of joints
    roughly perpendicular to the first will be developed. If the uplift be
    dome-shaped and sufficient to develop joints, they will radiate from
    the center. It is true that joints affect regions where the rocks have
    not been folded, and where they have been deformed but little, but
    deformation to some extent is well-nigh universal.</p>

  <p>A minor cause of tension-jointing is shrinkage, due (1) to cooling, as
    in the development of the columnar structure of certain lavas, and (2)
    to dessication, as shown by the cracks developed in mud when it dries.
    These causes, however, are not believed to affect rock structures to
    any considerable depth. Torsional joints and joints due to earthquake
    vibrations appear to be special phases of tension-joints.</p>

  <p>Two or more sets of joints may also be produced by compression,
    the number being dependent on the complexity of the folding. Many
    compression-joints correspond in direction with planes of shearing.
    They are often associated with minor faulting and with slaty cleavage.</p>

  <p>Tension-joints appear to be much more widely distributed than
    compression-joints.</p>

  <p><b>Sandstone dikes.—</b>Exceptionally, open joints are filled by the
    intrusion of sedimentary material from beneath. Thus have arisen the
    remarkable sandstone dikes<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> of the West, especially of California
    (<a href="#fig417"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 417</a>). Such dikes are sometimes several miles (nine at least) in
    length. The sand of these dikes was forced up from beneath either by
    earthquake movements or by hydrostatic pressure.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Faults.—</b>The beds on one side of a joint-plane or fissure are
    sometimes elevated or depressed relative to those on the opposite
    side, and the displacement is known as a <i>fault</i> (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> 418 and
    419). The joint-planes may have any position, and hence fault-planes
    may vary from verticality to approximate horizontality. The angle by
    which the fault-plane departs from a vertical position is known as
    the <i>hade</i> (<i>bac</i>, <a href="#fig418"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 418</a>). The vertical displacement
    (<i>ac</i>) is the <i>throw</i> and the horizontal displacement
    (<i>bc</i>) the <i>heave</i>. The heave and the throw are to be
    distinguished from the <i>displacement</i>, which is the amount of
    movement along the fault-plane (<i>ab</i>, <a href="#fig418"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 418</a>).</p>

  <p>The cliff above the edge of the downthrow side is a <i>fault-scarp</i>.
    In many, probably in most cases, the scarp has been destroyed, or at
    any rate greatly obscured by erosion; but occasionally fault-scarps of
    mountainous heights, as along the east face of the Sierras and along
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>many of the basin ranges of Utah, Nevada, etc., are found though much
    modified by erosion (<a href="#fig419"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 419</a>).</p>

  <p>Faults sometimes arise from over-intense folding (<a href="#fig420"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 420</a>). A
    deformation which at one point results merely in a bending of the beds,
    may occasion a fault at another. Faults may pass into folds either
    vertically (Figs. <a href="#fig421">421</a> and <a href="#fig422">422</a>) or horizontally (<a href="#fig423"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 423</a>). In such
    cases, thickening and thinning, and stretching and shortening of the
    beds is often involved (see <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig421">421</a> and <a href="#fig422">422</a>). Faults are often due to
    the greater settling of the beds on one side of a fissure than on the
    other, without special disposition to fold.</p>

  <p>The rock on either side of a fault-plane is often smoothed
    as the result of the friction of movement. Such surfaces are
    <i>slickensides</i> (<a href="#fig424"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 424</a>). A slickenside surface has some
    resemblance to a glaciated surface, but generally gives evidence of
    greater rigidity between the moving surfaces.</p>

  <p>Faults are of two general classes, <i>normal</i> and <i>reversed</i>.
    In the normal fault (<a href="#fig418"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 418</a>) the overhanging side is the downthrow
    side, i.e., the downthrow is on the side towards which the fault-plane
    inclines, as though the overhanging beds had slidden down the slope.
    Normal faults, as a rule, indicate an extension of strata, this being
    necessary to permit the dissevered blocks to settle downwards. In
    the reversed fault, the overhanging beds appear to have moved up
    the slope of the fault-plane, as though the displacement took place
    under lateral pressure. This is clearly shown to be the case where an
    overfold passes into a reversed fault (<a href="#fig420"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 420</a>). Reversed faults are
    further illustrated by <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig425">425</a>, <a href="#fig426">426</a>, and <a href="#fig427">427</a>. Where the plane of the
    reversed fault approaches horizontality, the fault is often called
    a <i>thrust-fault</i>, or an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span> <i>overthrust</i>. In such cases the
    throw is to be distinguished from the <i>stratigraphic throw</i> (see
    <a href="#fig426"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 426</a>). In thrust-faults, the heave is often great. The eastern
    face of the Rocky Mountains near the boundary-line between the United
    States and Canada has been pushed over the strata of the bordering
    plains to a distance of at least eight miles.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Overthrusts of like

  <p><b>The significance of faults.</b><a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>—Faults afford a valuable
    indication of the conditions of stress to which a region has been
    subjected, but some caution must be exercised in their interpretation.
    Normal faults usually indicate an extension of the surface sufficient
    to permit the fault-blocks to settle down unequally. Reversed faults
    usually signify a compression of the surface which requires the blocks
    to overlap one another more than they did before the faulting. In other
    words, normal faulting usually implies tensional stress, and reversed
    faulting compressional stress. It is not difficult to see, however,
    that in an intensely compressed and folded region there might be cases
    of normal faulting <span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>on the crests of folds where local stretching took
    place, and that reversed faults might occur even in regions of tension.
    But such cases must usually be local, and capable of detection and
    elimination by a study of the phenomena of the surrounding region.
    These exceptional cases aside, the general inference from prevailing
    normal faults is that the regions where they occur have undergone
    stretching, while the inference from the less widely distributed
    reversed faults is that the surface where they occur has undergone
    compression.</p>

  <p>In view of the current opinion that the crust of the earth has been
    subjected to great lateral thrust as a result of cooling, it is
    well to make especial note of the fact that the faults which imply
    <i>stretching</i> are called <i>normal</i> because they are the more
    abundant; and that the faults which imply thrust are less common, and
    are styled <i>reversed</i>. The numerical ratio of normal to reversed
    faults has never been closely determined, but normal faults very
    greatly preponderate, and are estimated by some writers to embrace
    90-odd per cent. of the whole. The testimony of normal faults is
    supported by the prevalence of gaping crevices, and of veins which are
    but crevices that stood open until they were filled by deposition. All
    these phenomena seem to testify to a <i>stretched</i> condition of the
    larger part of the surface of the continents. This will again claim
    attention in the study of Earth Movements.</p>

  <p><b>Effect of faulting on outcrops.—</b>Faulting may bring about
    numerous complications in the outcrop of rock formations. In a series
    of formations having a monoclinal structure (<a href="#fig436"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 436</a>), many changes
    may be introduced. Let it be supposed in the following cases that,
    after faulting, the surface has been reduced to planeness by erosion.
    If the fault-plane be parallel to the strike of the beds (<i>ab</i>,
    <a href="#fig436"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 436</a>), and hence a <i>strike fault</i>, the outcrop of a given
    layer may be duplicated (<i>H</i>, <a href="#fig437"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 437</a>), or it may be eliminated
    altogether (<a href="#fig438"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 438</a>). If the fault-plane be parallel to the direction
    of dip (<i>cd</i>, <a href="#fig436"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 436</a>), a <i>dip fault</i>, the layer <i>H</i>
    will outcrop, as in <a href="#fig439"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 439</a>, if the downthrow was on the far side,
    or as in <a href="#fig440"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 440</a> if the downthrow was on the opposite side. In both
    cases the outcrop <i>H</i> is <i>offset</i>, the amount of the offset
    decreasing with increasing angle of dip and increasing with increasing
    throw of the fault. If the fault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span> be oblique to the direction of dip
    and strike (<i>ef</i>, <a href="#fig436"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 436</a>), an <i>oblique fault</i>, the outcrop
    of such a layer as <i>H</i> will have the relations shown in <a href="#fig441"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 441</a>
    if the downthrow was to the left, and that shown in <a href="#fig442"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 442</a> if the
    downthrow was to the right. In the former case, it is said that there
    is <i>offset with overlap</i>; in the latter, <i>offset with gap</i>.
    The amount of the overlap and gap, respectively, increases with the
    increase of throw and hade, and decreases with increase of dip. In
    all cases the outcrop (after the degradation of the upthrow side) is
    shifted down dip.</p>

    sides of the fault, after the truncation of the folded beds. The
    distance is decreased on the upthrow side of a syncline (<a href="#fig443"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 443</a>) and
    increased on the upthrow side of an anticline (<a href="#fig444"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 444</a>). If the throw
    of a fault in tilted beds diminishes in one direction, it may cause
    beds to outcrop, as shown in <a href="#fig445"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 445</a>. Various other complications
    arise under other circumstances. Since faults rarely show themselves in
    the topography of the surface, except under special circumstances (see
    <a href="#Page_151"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 151</a>), their detection and measurement is usually based on the study

  <div class="subheadc">THE MOVEMENTS AND DEFORMATIONS OF THE EARTH’S BODY (DIASTROPHISM).</div>

  <p><span class="smcap">The</span> body of the earth is subject to an infinite variety of movements,
    ranging from the almost inconceivably rapid to the almost imperceptibly
    slow, and from the almost immeasurably minute to the enormously
    massive; but, for practical treatment, they fall mainly into two
    couplets: (1) the minute and rapid, and (2) the slow and massive.
    Sudden movements of local masses, giving rise to intense vibrations,
    are put in the first class. There are innumerable minute and slow
    movements, but unless they rise to appreciable magnitude by long
    continuance, they are neglected.</p>

  <h3>MINUTE AND RAPID MOVEMENTS.</h3>

  <p>The crust of the earth is in a state of perpetual tremor. For the
    most part, these tremors are too minute to be sensible, but are
    revealed by delicate instrumental devices. Some of them are but the
    declining stages of sensible vibrations, but others are minute from
    their inception. Many of them spring from the ordinary incidents of
    the surface, and claim attention chiefly as obstacles to the study of
    more significant oscillations. Winds, waves, waterfalls, the tread of
    animals, the rumble of traffic, the blasts of mines, the changes of
    temperature, the variations in atmospheric pressure, the weighting of
    rainfall and the lightening of evaporation, the rupture of rock or ice
    or frozen earth, and many other processes, make their contributions
    to local and minute movements. For the greater part, these vibrations
    are superficial in origin, and are soon damped beyond recognition by
    dispersal and by the inelastic and discontinuous nature of the looser
    material of the surface. When a temporary rigid crust is formed by
    freezing, as in winter, these surface vibrations are transmitted with
    much less loss, and the distances at which the rumble of winter traffic
    is heard, is a good illustration of the function of continuity and
    solidity in the conveyance of vibrations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span></p>

  <h4><i>Earthquakes.</i></h4>

  <p>When the tremors spring from sources within the earth itself and are of
    appreciable violence, they are recognized as earthquakes. The sources
    of earthquake tremors are various. The most prevalent is probably the
    fracture of rocks and the slipping of strata on each other in the
    process of faulting. The interpretation of movements of this class
    has now been so far perfected that the length and depth of the fault,
    the amount of the slip, and the direction of the hade are capable of
    approximate estimation.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> To the same class belong the movements
    due to slumping. They are illustrated by the sliding and arrest of
    great masses of sediment along the steep fronts of deltas, and of
    the accumulations of deep-sea oozes on steep submarine slopes. Such
    slumping is, in reality, superficial faulting. Seismic tremors often
    attend volcanic eruptions, and are then probably attributable to the
    sudden fracture and displacement of rock by the penetration of lava,
    or by rapid and unequal heating. They are perhaps also due sometimes
    to the sudden generation or cooling of steam in underground conduits,
    crevices, and caverns, the action possibly being in some cases of the
    “water-hammer” type. In rare instances, probably, the bursting of beds
    overlying pent-up non-volcanic gases may give origin to earthquakes. A
    more superficial source of earthquake vibrations is the collapse of the
    roofs of subterranean caverns.</p>

  <p>Seismic vibrations seem to be in part compressional, in part
    distortional, in part (on the surface) undulatory, and in part
    irregular. The distortional are especially significant, as they seem to
    imply a solid medium of transmission.</p>

  <p><b>Points of origin, foci.—</b>It is probable that nearly or quite all
    earthquake movements start within the upper ten miles of the crust,
    and most of them within the upper five. Some of the earlier estimates
    indeed placed the points of origin as deep as 20 or 30 miles, but in
    these cases the necessary corrections, discussed below, were neglected.
    Most of the recent and more accurate estimates fall within the limits
    given.</p>

  <p>The method of estimating the depth of the centers of disturbance
    consists in observing the directions of throw or thrust of bodies
    at the surface, and in regarding these as representing the lines
    of emergence of the earthquake-waves. By plotting these lines of
    emergence, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>projecting them backwards to their underground
    crossings, a first approximation to the location of the focus is
    reached (the lines <i>EF′</i>, <a href="#fig446"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 446</a>). From the nature of the case,
    the observations of the angles of emergence cannot be very accurate,
    but an effort is made to limit the error by making the number of
    observations great.</p>

  <p>Two systematic corrections are to be applied to all such estimates,
    the one for varying elasticity and density, and the other for
    varying continuity. Both reduce the estimated depth. In making the
    correction for varying elasticity, it must be noted that the velocity
    of vibrations varies directly as the square root of the elasticity,
    and inversely as the square root of the density. The velocity is also
    accelerated by increase of temperature. The elasticity, temperature,
    and density all increase with depth. Theoretically, the increase of
    velocity due to the increasing elasticity and temperature of increasing
    depths, overbalances the retardation due to increasing density, and
    recent observations on the transmission of seismic waves through deep
    chords of the earth have confirmed this conclusion. The path of the
    vibration will, therefore, be curved toward the surface, as pointed out
    by Schmidt and illustrated in <a href="#fig446"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 446</a>, taken from his discussion.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
    From this it is clear <span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>that the focus is not so deep as implied by the
    simple backward projection of the lines of emergence.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig446">
    <img class="illowp100" src="images/fig446.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 446.—Diagram illustrating by closed
    curves the different rates of propagation of seismic tremors from a
    focus <i>F</i>, and, by lines normal to these, the changing directions
    of propagation of the wave-front. It will be seen that the paths of
    propagation curve upwards in approaching the surface. If the lines of
    emergence, as at <i>E</i> and <i>E</i>, be projected backwards, as to
    <i>F′</i>, the points of crossing will be below the true focus.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>A second correction must be made for the differences of continuity
    of the upper rock in the vertical and horizontal directions. In the
    outer part of the earth, the continuity in horizontal directions is
    interrupted by vertical fissures. Were these not usually filled with
    water, they would soon kill the horizontal component of the seismic
    wave, and the residual portion would be directed almost vertically to
    the surface, for the width of the fissures is almost always greater
    than the amplitude of the seismic vibrations. The water restores the
    continuity, in a measure, but not perfectly, for the elasticity of
    water is much less than that of rock. It is clear that in horizontal
    movement there must be a constant transfer from rock to water and from
    water to rock, and this must retard, as well as partially destroy, the
    vibrations. In a vertical direction, however, the rocks rest firmly
    upon one another, and this gives measurable continuity, the only change
    being from one layer or kind of rock to another. It seems certain,
    therefore, that the vertical component of the seismic wave will be less
    damped and less retarded in transmission than the horizontal. It will,
    therefore, reach the surface sooner and will have the greater effect on
    bodies at the surface, not only for the reasons given, but also because
    it emerges more nearly in the line of least resistance and of freest
    projection. On this account, a second correction must be added to the
    correction for elasticity, and this must further reduce appreciably the
    first estimate of the depth of the focus.</p>

  <p>Observation shows that in some way a seismic wave becomes separated in
    transmission into portions of different natures and speeds, but their
    interpretation is yet uncertain. These separated portions probably
    consist of the compressional, the distortional, and the undulatory
    waves, and perhaps of refractions and reflections of these (see <a href="#fig448"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    448</a>).</p>

  <p>A most important recent achievement is the detection and investigation
    of seismic tremors that appear to have come <i>through</i> the earth.
    The transmission of such waves promises to reveal much relative to the
    nature of the deep interior, when enough data are gathered to warrant
    conclusions. The rate of propagation in the central parts is found to
    be greater than in the outer parts, implying high elasticity within.</p>

  <p><b>The amplitude of the vibrations.—</b>From the very disastrous
    effects of severe earthquakes, it is natural to infer that the
    distinctive oscillations must have large amplitude, but in fact it
    is the suddenness of the vibration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span> rather than its length, that is
    effective. Instrumental investigations indicate that the oscillations,
    after they have left their points of origin, are usually only a
    fraction of a millimeter in amplitude; at most they seldom exceed a few
    millimeters. A sudden shock with an amplitude of 5 or 6 millimeters is
    sufficient to shatter a chimney. It is true that estimates assigning
    amplitudes of a foot or more have been made, but their correctness is
    open to serious doubt. It should be understood that it is the length
    of oscillation of the particles of the subsurface rock transmitting
    the vibrations that is referred to, not the movement of the free
    surface, or of objects on the surface. The throw at and on the surface
    is much greater. Just as a slight, quick tap of a hammer on a floor
    is sufficient to make a marble lying on it bound several inches, so
    a sufficiently sudden rise of the surface of the earth, though but a
    fraction of an inch, may project loose bodies many feet.</p>

  <p><b>Destructive effects.—</b>The interpretation of the disastrous
    results of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span> earthquake shocks has, therefore, its key in the suddenness
    and strength of rather minute vibrations of the earth-matter, but it
    is also dependent on the freedom of motion of the bodies affected. The
    rocks of the deeper zones, where the matter is sensibly continuous,
    transmit the seismic vibrations without appreciable disruptive effect,
    so far as known, though the origin of crevices has been assigned to
    this cause; but bodies at the surface are fractured, overturned, and
    hurled from their places. The reason is doubtless this: Within a great
    mass firmly held in place by cohesion and pressure on all sides, the
    forward motion of a particle develops an equal elastic resistance,
    and it is quickly thrown back again and the wave passes on. At the
    surface, where bodies are freer to move, the stroke of the vibration
    projects the body, and so, instead of vibratory resilience, the chief
    energy is converted into mass-motion. The tap of a hammer sends an
    almost imperceptible vibration along the floor, but this vibration may
    throw a glass ball, beneath which it runs, into the air. So the minute
    vibrations of earth-matter may travel miles from their origin through
    continuous substance with little result, and then so suddenly thrust a
    loose body on the surface, or the base of a column, or the foundation
    of a house, as to rack it with differential strains, or even to hurl
    it to destruction. So, too, earth-waves striking the sea-border may
    thrust the waters off shore by their sudden impact, and the reaction
    may develop a wave which overwhelms the coast. Such waves may doubtless
    arise from a sudden stroke of seismic vibrations on the sea-bottom.
    The great gaping fissures that sometimes open during earthquakes occur
    oftenest where the surface on one side is less well supported than on
    the other, as on a slope, or near a bluff-face or a river-channel. When
    in such situations the earth is once suddenly forced in the direction
    of least resistance, it is not always met by sufficient elastic
    resistance to throw it back. Sometimes, however, there is an elastic
    return, and the fissure closes forcibly an instant after it is opened.</p>

  <p><b>Direction of throw.—</b>Immediately above the point of origin,
    technically the <i>epicentrum</i> or <i>epi-focal point</i>, bodies
    are projected upwards. When crushing takes place in such a case,
    it is due to the upthrust or to the return downfall. At one side
    of the epicentrum the thrust is oblique in various degrees, and is
    usually more destructive, if not too far from the epicentrum. The
    destructiveness commonly increases for a certain distance from the
    epi-focal point, and then diminishes. Under ideal conditions, the
    greatest effects are found where the vibration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span> emerges at an angle
    of about 45°, but various influences modify this result. Lines drawn
    through points of equal effect (isoseismals) are not usually regular
    circles or ellipses about the epicentrum, as they would be under ideal
    conditions. The various divergencies represent differences of effective
    elasticity, of surface, and of other influences. As most earthquakes
    originate from lines, planes, or masses, rather than points, there are
    doubtless differences of intensity of vibration at different points on
    the lines, planes, or areas of origin, and these differences introduce
    inequalities in propagation and in surface effects.</p>

    four diagrams represent the same set of tremors as received at Shide,
    Kew, Bidston, and Edinburgh in Great Britain. The movement was from
    left to right. (Milne.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Rate of propagation.—</b>The progress of a seismic wave varies very
    greatly. Both experimental tests and natural observations give very
    discordant results. At present, they justify only the broad statement
    that the velocity of propagation varies from several hundreds to
    several thousands of feet per second at the surface. The rate seems to
    be greater for strong vibrations than for weak ones, and hence it is
    faster near the origin than farther away. The strength of a vibration
    dies away, theoretically, according to the inverse square of the
    distance from the point of origin. Practically there is to be added to
    this the partial destruction of the vibrations by conversion into other
    forms of motion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span></p>

  <p><b>Sequences of vibrations.—</b>Near the source, the main shocks
    are apt to come suddenly and to be followed by minor tremors. At a
    distance there are usually “preliminary” vibrations followed by the
    main tremors, and these by others of gradually diminishing value. This
    development is assigned to different rates of propagation, and to
    refractions and reflections not unlike the prolongation of thunder (see
    <a href="#fig448"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 448</a>). This deployment of the vibrations is notably developed in
    the shocks that pass long distances through the earth. The vibrations
    of the first phase are regarded as compressional, those of the second
    as distortional, while the largest oscillations which arise still later
    perhaps come around the surface, and may be undulatory, though their
    nature is not yet determined.</p>

  <p>There is often, however, a true succession of original shocks caused by
    a succession of slips or ruptures at the source. Sometimes these are
    exceedingly persistent, running through days, weeks, or even months. In
    such cases a slow faulting is probably in progress, and little slips
    and stops follow in close succession. In one instance as many as 600
    shocks in ten days have been reported.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

  <p><b>Gaseous emanations.—</b>Vapors and gas frequently issue from
    earthquake rents, and are popularly made to serve as causes, but they
    are usually merely the earth gases that are permitted to escape by
    the rending of the ground, or are forced out by readjustment of the
    shaken beds. Like other subterranean gases, they are often sulphurous,
    and they are sometimes hot, especially in volcanic regions. Where the
    shocks are connected with eruptions, the gases may be truly volcanic.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution of earthquakes.—</b>Over large portions of the globe,
    severe earthquakes are exceedingly rare, but in certain regions they
    are unfortunately frequent. For the most part, these are volcanic
    districts, but this is by no means a universal relation. Earthquakes
    and volcanoes are only in part associates. In general, it may be said
    that earthquakes are frequent where geologic changes are in rapid
    progress, as along belts of young mountains, where the stresses are
    not yet adjusted, or at the mouths of great streams, where deltas are
    accumulating, or about volcanoes, where temperatures and strains are
    changing, or on the great slopes, particularly the submarine slopes,
    where readjustments in response to inequalities of surface stress are
    in progress. Not a few, however, occur where the special occasion is
    not at all obvious.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span></p>
  <h4><i>The Geologic Effects of Earthquakes.</i></h4>

  <p>Earthquakes are of much less importance, geologically, than many
    gentler movements and activities. Disastrous as they sometimes are to
    human affairs, they leave few distinct and readily identifiable marks
    which are more than temporary.</p>

  <p><b>Fracturing of rock.—</b>During the passage of notable earthquake
    waves, the solid rock is probably often fractured (see <a href="#Page_509"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 509</a>), though
    where it is covered by deep soil the fractures are rarely observable
    at the surface. Elsewhere the crevices are readily seen, especially
    if they gape. In a few instances surface-rock has been seen to be
    thoroughly shattered after the passage of an earthquake, as in the
    Concepcion earthquake of 1835.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Joints which were before closed are
    often opened during an earthquake. Thus in northern Arizona, not far
    from Canyon Diablo, there is a crevice traceable for a considerable
    distance, which is said to have been opened during an earthquake.
    Locally, it gaps several feet. Other notable earthquake fissures
    have been recorded in India,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Japan, and New Zealand. During an
    earthquake which shook the South Island of New Zealand in 1848, “a
    fissure was formed averaging 18 inches in width, and traceable for a
    distance of 60 miles, parallel to the axis of the adjacent mountain
    chain.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The development of fractures or the opening of joints is
    sometimes accompanied by faulting. This was the case in Japan during
    the earthquake of October 28, 1891, when the surface on one side of a
    fissure, which could be traced for 40 miles, sank 2 to 20 feet. In this
    case there was also notable horizontal displacement, the east wall of
    the fissure being thrust locally as much as 13 feet to the north.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

  <p><b>Changes of surface.—</b>Circular surface openings or basins are
    sometimes developed during earthquakes. This was the case during the
    Charleston earthquake of 1886,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> and similar effects have been
    noted elsewhere. These openings often serve as avenues of escape for
    ground-water, gases, and vapor. They are commonly supposed to be the
    result <span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>of the collapse of caverns, or other subterranean openings, the
    collapse often causing the forcible ejection of water. Such openings
    are likely to be formed only where the surface material is incoherent.
    Sandstone dikes (<a href="#Page_514"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 514</a>) may perhaps be associated in origin with
    earthquakes.</p>

  <p>Earthquakes are likely to dislodge masses of rock in unstable
    positions, as on slopes or cliffs. They may also occasion slumps and
    landslides.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

  <p><b>Effects on drainage.—</b>The fracturing of the rock may interfere
    with the movement of ground-water. After new cracks are developed, or
    old ones opened or closed, the movement of ground-water adapts itself
    to the new conditions. It follows that springs sometimes cease to
    flow after an earthquake, while new ones break out where there had
    been none before. The character of the water of springs is sometimes
    changed, presumably because it comes from different sources after the
    earthquake. Joints may be so widened as to intercept rivulets, and
    the waters thus intercepted may cause the further enlargement of the
    opening. Illustrations of this sort are furnished by the earthquakes
    of the Mississippi valley (<abbr title="Latitude">Lat.</abbr> 36° to 38°) in 1811–12. Where faults
    accompany earthquakes, they occasion ponds or falls where they cross
    streams. Illustrations of both were furnished by the Chedrang River of
    India after the earthquake of 1897.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

  <p><b>Effects on standing water.—</b>Some of the most destructive effects
    of earthquakes are felt along the borders of the sea. Thus the great
    sea-wave of the Lisbon earthquake (1755) and that of the earthquake
    which affected the coasts of Ecuador and Peru in 1868 are examples.
    Such waves have been known to advance on the land as walls of water 60
    feet in height. They are most destructive along low coasts, for here
    the water may sweep much more extensively over the land. The great
    loss of life during an earthquake has usually been the direct result
    of the great waves. Lakes are also affected by earthquakes, their
    waters sometimes rising and falling for several hours after the initial
    disturbance, but lake-waves are much feebler than those of the sea, and
    are not often destructive.</p>

  <p>Earthquake shocks are sometimes remarkably destructive to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>life
    of lakes and seas. Thus during the Indian earthquake of 1897, “fishes
    were killed in myriads as by the explosion of a dynamite cartridge ...
    and for days after the earthquake, the river (Sumesari) was choked
    with thousands of dead fish ... and two floating carcasses of Gangetic
    dolphins were seen which had been killed by the shock.”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> This
    wholesale destruction of life is of interest, since the surfaces of
    layers of rock, often of great age, are sometimes covered with fossils
    of fish or other animal forms, so numerous and so preserved as to
    indicate that the animals were killed suddenly and in great numbers,
    and their bodies quickly buried. It has been suggested that such rock
    surfaces may be memorials of ancient earthquake shocks.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

  <p><b>Changes of level.—</b>Permanent changes of level sometimes accompany
    an earthquake. Thus after the earthquake of 1822 “the coast of Chili
    for a long distance was said to have risen 3 or 4 feet.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Similar
    results have occurred on the same coast at other times, and on other
    coasts at various times. Depression of the surface is perhaps even
    more common than elevation. Thus on the coast of India all except the
    higher parts of an area 60 square miles in extent were sunk below the
    sea during an earthquake in 1762. Widespread depression in the vicinity
    of the Mississippi in Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee
    accompanied the earthquakes of 1811 and 1812. Some of the depressed
    areas were converted into marshes, while others became the sites of
    permanent lakes. Reelfoot Lake, mainly in Tennessee, is an example.
    Change of level is involved wherever there is faulting, and faulting is
    probably rather common in connection with earthquakes.</p>

  <p>Changes of level are not confined to the land. Where earthquake
    disturbances affect the sea-bottom in regions of telegraph cables, the
    cables are often broken. In such cases notable changes have sometimes
    been discovered and recorded when the cables were repaired. Striking
    examples are furnished by the region about Greece.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> In one instance
    (1873) the repairing vessel found about 2000 feet of water where about
    1400 feet existed when the cable was laid. In another instance (1878)
    the bottom was “so irregular and uneven for a distance of about two
    miles, that a detour was made and the cable lengthened <span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>by five or
    six miles.” In still another case (1885) the repairing vessel found a
    “difference of 1500 feet between the bow and stern soundings.” These
    records point to sea-bottom faulting on a large scale.</p>

  <p>It is probably no nearer the truth to say that changes of level result
    from earthquakes than to say that earthquakes result from changes of
    level. The two classes of phenomena are probably to be referred to a
    common cause.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

  <h3>SLOW MASSIVE MOVEMENTS.</h3>

  <p>It is a far cry from the intense and inconceivably rapid oscillations
    of the earthquake, to the excessively slow subsidences of continents,
    or even the slow wrinkling of mountain folds. Not infrequently rivers
    wear down their channels across a mountain range as fast as it rises
    athwart them. The movements of continents are even more deliberate.
    But, far apart as these contrasted movements are, in rate and method,
    they are associated in ultimate causation, and the earthquake shock is
    often merely an incident in the formation of a mountain range or in the
    subsidence of a continent.</p>

  <p>The great movements are usually classed (1) as continent-making
    (epeirogenic) and (2) mountain-making (orogenic). They may also be
    classed as (1) vertical movements and (2) horizontal movements, and
    dynamically, as (1) thrust movements and (2) stretching movements.
    It is to be understood that these distinctions are little more than
    analytical conveniences, for continental movements are often at the
    same time mountain-making movements; vertical movements are usually
    involved in horizontal movements, and stretching usually takes part in
    the processes in which thrust predominates, and <i>vice versa</i>. But
    where one phase greatly preponderates, it may conveniently give name to
    the whole.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span></p>

  <p><b>Present movements.—</b>Critical observations on seacoasts show that
    some shores are slowly rising and some slowly sinking <i>relative to
      the ocean-level</i>. We do not certainly know what their movements are
    relative to the center of the earth; very possibly all may be sinking,
    one set faster than the other, the ocean-surface also going down at an
    intermediate rate. Theoretically, all might possibly be rising, one
    set faster than the other, the ocean also rising at an intermediate
    rate, though this is extremely improbable. One set may be actually
    rising relative to the center of the earth, and the other sinking,
    while the ocean-level is stationary, or nearly so. This is the way in
    which we are accustomed to interpret them. A general shrinkage of the
    earth, however, is probably going on, carrying down land-surface and
    sea-surface. It has been urged by Suess<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> that the general shrinkage
    is so great that the local upward warpings and foldings never equal
    it, and that the real movements are all downward, though in different
    degrees. This is probably the general fact at least. Over against this
    is the popular disposition to regard earth movements generally as
    “upheavals.” There is also a predilection for regarding the rigid land
    as moving and the mobile sea-level as fixed. In reality, the sea is an
    extremely adaptive body that settles into the irregular hollows of the
    lithosphere, and is shifted about with every warping of the latter.
    Whatever change affects the capacity of its depressions affects also
    the sea-level. If they are increased, the sea settles more deeply into
    them; if they are decreased, the sea spreads out more widely on the
    borders of the land. The one thing that gives a measure of stability
    to the sea-level is the fact that all the great basins are connected,
    and so an <i>average</i> is maintained. A warping down in one part of
    the sea-bottom may be offset by an upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span> warping somewhere else in
    the 72% of the earth’s surface covered by the ocean, and so it is only
    the <i>sum total of all changes</i> in the sea-bottoms and borders
    that effects the common level. Thus it happens that, notwithstanding
    its instability and its complete subordination to the lithosphere,
    the sea-level is the most convenient basis of reference, and has
    become the accepted datum-plane. If there were some available mode
    of measuring the distance of points from the center of the earth, it
    would give absolute data and absolute terms, and would reveal much
    that is now uncertain respecting the real movements of the surface.
    For convenience, however, since absolute terms are impracticable, the
    ordinary language of geology, which represents movements as upward
    and downward, according to their relations to the sea-level or to the
    average surface, will be employed. Notwithstanding this concession to
    convenience in the use of terms, it is of the greatest importance to
    form, and to constantly retain, true fundamental views.</p>

  <p><b>Fundamental conceptions.—</b>The existence of any land at all is
    dependent on the inequalities of the surface and of the density of the
    lithosphere, for if it were perfectly spheroidal and equidense, the
    hydrosphere would cover it completely to a depth of about two miles.
    Not only are inequalities necessary to the existence of land, but these
    inequalities must be <i>renewed from time to time</i>, or the land area
    would soon, geologically speaking, be covered by the sea. The renewal
    has been made again and again in geological history by movements that
    have increased the inequalities in the surface of the lithosphere.
    With each such movement, apparently, the oceans have withdrawn more
    completely within the basins, and the continents have stood forth more
    broadly and relatively higher, until again worn down. This renewal of
    inequalities appears to have been, in its great features, a <i>periodic
      movement</i>, recurring at long intervals. In the intervening times,
    the sea has crept out over the lower parts of the continents, moving
    on steadily and slowly toward their complete submersion, which would
    inevitably have been attained if no interruption had checked and
    reversed the process. These are the great movements of the earth, and
    in them lies, we believe, the soul of geologic history and the basis
    for its grand divisions. The reasons for this will appear as the
    history is followed, and its most potential agencies are seen unfolding
    themselves. At the same time, there have been numerous minor surface
    movements in almost constant progress. While these two classes of
    movements have been associated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span> and are perhaps due in the main to the
    same causes, they are sufficiently different in some of their dynamic
    aspects to be separated in treatment.</p>

  <h4><i>Nearly Constant Small Movements.</i></h4>

  <p>Innumerable gentle warpings have affected nearly every portion of the
    surface of the globe at nearly all stages of its history. Not only
    during the periods of great movements were there countless minor and
    gentler movements, but at times of relative quiescence there were
    slow swellings and saggings of the surface of the lithosphere. They
    sometimes affected small areas and sometimes large ones, and they
    were sometimes of upward phase and sometimes of downward. They were
    the immediate agencies in locating and controlling the deposition
    of stratified rocks, though they rest back on the great movements
    for their working conditions. Very slow sinkings of sea-borders have
    permitted deposition to go on in shallow water for long periods without
    being interrupted by the local filling of the sea. Very slow swellings
    of land tracts, relative or absolute, have permitted erosion to supply
    material for such sedimentation for long periods without exhausting the
    sources. Very slow upward warpings in one region and downward warpings
    in another have shifted the borders of the land and sea, and with them
    the areas of erosion and deposition. Thus have arisen overlaps and
    unconformities of strata and diversities in their distribution from
    stage to stage. Such movements may have amounted to a few inches, or
    a few feet, or a few fathoms per century. Downward movements have
    sometimes affected a considerable section of a continent, letting
    in a shallow <i>epicontinental</i> sea upon it, such, for example,
    as the North Sea upon the northwestern border of the continent of
    Europe, and Hudson Bay upon the northeastern part of North America.
    Similar movements seem to have extended the seas even more widely
    upon the surface of the land in times past, as attested by the great
    transgressions of the ocean-borders and the great epicontinental spread
    of strata. Notwithstanding their great breadths, the epicontinental
    seas were generally shallow. Similar gentle warpings of upward phase
    rescued the bottoms of shallow seas from submersion, and inaugurated
    erosion; or they bowed base-leveled lands upward, and rejuvenated
    their streams and inaugurated a new cycle of denudation. Often they
    connected continents previously separated by shallow straits, and thus
    inaugurated inter-continental migrations of land life, while they
    stopped inter-oceanic migration.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span></p>

  <p>The gentleness and frequency of these movements is attested by the
    character of the sediments and by their relations to one another, as
    will be seen in the study of the sedimentary series.</p>

  <p><b>Reciprocal features.—</b>These minor warpings show a notable
    tendency to be reciprocal. If one area is bowed up, another near by is
    bowed down. If the continents settle, the oceans rise on their borders.
    If the land is cut down, the sea is filled up. There is an important
    phase of this deserving especial note. Certain tracts have been slowly
    bowed upwards into long land swells, the streams being rejuvenated and
    degradation hastened. Adjacent tracts have been slowly bowed downwards
    into long parallel troughs which received the wash from the adjacent
    swells, and thus became tracts of exceptional sedimentation. Such a
    tract of parallel swell and sag, if our interpretation be correct,
    developed along the Atlantic border of North America in the Paleozoic
    era. By the slow upward warping of the swells, the feeding-grounds of
    the streams were maintained, and the sags were filled about as fast
    as they sank. Thus a great depth of sediment was laid down in the
    course of an era measured by millions of years. So in other regions,
    especially near the borders of the continents, there have been similar
    reciprocal movements, giving at once feeding-grounds for the streams
    and lodgment-grounds for the sediments, side by side in parallel
    belts. It is a common view that these belts of deep sedimentation were
    the forerunners of mountain formation, and that they determined the
    formation of the mountains. In view of the grounds for doubting the
    efficiency of so superficial an agency in mountain formation, which
    will appear as we go on, it may be well to hold this view in abeyance,
    and to dwell on the reciprocal nature of the action, in which the
    upward bowing that gave the feeding-grounds is as vital a factor as
    the sagging that accommodated the sedimentation. It is important to
    recognize that in so far as the crust was weak enough to yield to
    these gentler forces, it was not strong enough to accumulate the great
    stresses necessary to form mountain ranges, and further, that in so far
    as the stresses were eased by the gentle warping, they could not be
    accumulated for the later work of mountain-folding. It is nevertheless
    probable that the conditions which located the gentle swelling and
    sagging also located the mountain-folding.</p>

  <h4><i>The Great Periodic Movements.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Mountain-forming movements.—</b>Along certain tracts, usually
    near the borders of the continents, and at certain times, usually
    separated by long intervals, the crust was folded into gigantic
    wrinkles, and these constitute the chief type of mountains, though not
    the only type. The characteristic force in this folding was lateral
    thrust. The strata were not only arched, but often closely folded,
    and sometimes intensely crumpled. In extreme cases, like the Alps,
    the folds flared out above, giving overturn dips and reversed strata,
    as illustrated in the chapter on Structural Geology, <a href="#Page_501"><abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 501–511</a>. In
    these cases there was an upward as well as a horizontal movement, for
    the folds themselves were lifted; but the horizontal thrust so much
    preponderated, and was so much the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span> remarkable, that the upward
    movement was overshadowed. It is well to note, however, that these
    mountain ranges are crumpled <i>outward</i> and not <i>inward</i>, as
    might be expected if they resulted simply from the shrinkage of the
    under side of a thin shell. The folds are sometimes nearly upright and
    symmetrical, and sometimes inclined and asymmetrical, as illustrated in
    the chapter referred to. Where the folds lean, the inference has been
    drawn that the active thrust came from the side of the gentler slope,
    the folds being pushed over toward the resisting side, and this seems
    to be commonly true. The original attitude of the beds, however, has
    much to do with the character of the folds.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> By a slight change in
    the mode of thrust, sheets of paper may be so pushed as to lean forward
    or backward at pleasure. The leaning of the folds seems, therefore,
    a doubtful criterion for determining the direction of the active
    movement. Mountains of the thrust type usually consist of a series of
    folds nearly parallel to each other, the whole forming an anticlinorium.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution of folded ranges.—</b>The prevailing location of this
    class of mountains is so generally near the borders of the continents
    that the relation is probably significant. Dana<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> long ago called
    attention to the fact that the greatest mountain ranges stand opposite
    the greatest ocean-basins, and he connected the elevation of the one
    with the depression of the other. One of the most notable exceptions
    to this relation is the complex system of southern Europe, from the
    Pyrenees to the Caucasus, and another is the Altai and connected ranges
    (<a href="#fig449"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 449</a>). The Urals and not a few minor ranges are also exceptions.
    It is probably better to regard the crumpled tracts as lying on the
    borders of great segments of the earth that acted essentially as units,
    and to regard the relationship to the sea as a coincidence that is only
    in part causal.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

  <p><b>Plateau-forming movements.—</b>Another leading phase of crustal
    movement is the settling or rising of great blocks of the crust, as
    though by vertical rather than horizontal force. The western plateau of
    North America and the great plateau of Thibet are gigantic examples.
    The American plateau embraces numerous blocks which, while they have
    been elevated together, are individually tilted in their own fashion.
    At <span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>the surface, they are separated by fault-planes, but below, some
    of them, and perhaps most of them, pass into flexures. Most of these
    flexures are of the monoclinal type (<a href="#Page_516"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 516</a>), which dynamically means
    much the same as a fault; but some of them may be of the compressive
    type, without inconsistency with vertical fault-relief above. Research
    has not yet covered thoroughly any great plateau, and knowledge of
    this class of movements is less complete than that of folding by
    lateral thrust, and it has a less ample place in the literature of the
    subject. The plateau-forming movements are, however, much more massive
    than the mountain-folding movements, and stand next in magnitude to
    the continent-forming movements. Plateaus may be regarded as smaller
    platforms superposed on the continental platforms.</p>

  <p>In the ocean-basins, there appear to be raised platforms of the
    plateau type, and there are remarkable “deeps” that have the aspect of
    anti-plateaus.</p>

  <p><b>Continent-forming movements.—</b>True continent-forming movements
    appear to have antedated the earliest known sediments. As far back
    as we can read the sedimentary record, the continents seem to have
    been well established, and there is little evidence that they have
    since been fundamentally changed. It is true that some very eminent
    geologists have rather freely connected formations on one continent
    with formations having similar faunas on an opposite continent, by a
    hypothetical conversion of the intervening ocean-bottoms into land
    or shallow water; but most such faunal relations can be explained
    almost equally well by migration around the coasts, or at most by
    mere ridge-connections. The paucity, if not total absence, of abysmal
    deposits in the strata of the continents, taken with the persistence
    of terrestrial and coastal faunas, leaves little room for assigning
    an interchange of position between abysmal depths and continental
    elevations, and <i>vice versa</i>. Dynamic considerations also offer
    grave difficulties. The doctrine of the persistence of continents
    probably ought not to be pushed so far as to exclude shallow water, or
    even land, connections between South America, Antarctica, Australia,
    India, and South Africa, directly or indirectly, at certain stages
    of geological history. Without forming final conclusions as to the
    measure of the change which the continents have suffered during known
    geological history, it is safe to conclude that the continents and
    ocean-basins were in the main formed very early in the earth’s history,
    and that subsequent changes have consisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span> chiefly in the further
    sinking of the basins and the further protrusion of the land, save as
    the latter has been cut down by erosion. Incidentally, the ocean-basins
    have probably been extended and the continents restricted. On the other
    hand, the continents have been built out on their borders by wash
    from the land, and the waters of the ocean have been somewhat lifted
    by the deposition of sediment in their basins. It is estimated that
    the cutting away of the present continents, and the deposition of the
    material in the ocean-basins, would raise the sea-level about 650 feet.
    (R. D. George.)</p>

  <p><b>Relations of these movements in time.—</b>The folding movements seem
    to have had extraordinary prevalence in the earliest ages, for the
    Archean rocks are almost universally crumpled, and often in the most
    intricate fashion. There is no sign that the folding was then limited
    to the borders of the continents; it seems rather to have affected
    the whole continental surface. After the beginning of the well-known
    sedimentary series, crumpling appears to have taken place chiefly at
    long intervals, thus marking off great time-divisions, and to have been
    confined at any given stage to certain tracts, chiefly on the borders
    of great segments of the earth’s crust.</p>

  <p>Concerning the plateau-forming movements in the past, knowledge is very
    meager, as the detection of plateaus of ancient times is more difficult
    than the detection of folds. Gentle warpings have apparently been in
    progress at all times.</p>

  <p><b>Relations of vertical to horizontal movements.—</b>The downward
    movements are unquestionably the primary ones, and the horizontal ones
    are secondary and incidental. The fundamental feature is doubtless
    central condensation actuated by gravity, and the master movements
    are the sinkings of the ocean-basins. The great periodic movements
    that made mountains and plateaus, and changed the capacity of the
    ocean-basins, probably started with the sinking of part or all of the
    ocean-bottoms. In the greater periodic movements, probably all the
    basins participated more or less, but some seem to have been more
    active than others. For example, in the last great mountain-making
    period, the Pacific basin seems to have been more active than the
    Atlantic, while in the similar great event at the close of the
    Paleozoic, the opposite seems to have been true. The squeezing up of
    the continents doubtless took place simultaneously with the settling of
    the basins. The true conception is perhaps that the ocean-basins and
    continental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span> platforms are but the surface forms of great segments of
    the lithosphere, all of which crowd toward the center, the stronger and
    heavier segments taking precedence and squeezing the weaker and lighter
    ones between them. The area of the more depressed or master segments
    is almost exactly twice that of the protruding or squeezed ones. This
    estimate includes in the latter about 10,000,000 square miles now
    covered with shallow water. The volume of the hydrosphere is a little
    too great for the true basins, and it runs over, covering the borders
    of the continents. The amount of the overflow fluctuates from time to
    time, and may be neglected in a study of the movements and deformations
    of the lithosphere.</p>

  <p><b>The squeezed segments.—</b>The great protruding segments show a
    tendency toward rude triangularity. They are (1) the Eurasian, now
    strongly ridged on the south and east, and relatively flat on the
    northwest; (2) the African, rather strongly ridged on the east,
    but less abruptly elevated on the west and north; (3) the North
    American, now strongly ridged on the west, more gently on the east,
    and relatively flat at the north and in the interior; (4) the South
    American, strongly ridged on the west and somewhat on the northeast and
    southeast.</p>

  <p>The foregoing form the major group. The minor group embraces (5) the
    Antarctic segment, not as yet sufficiently known to be well defined,
    and (6) the Australian, broadly reniform rather than triangular. To
    these are perhaps to be added (7) the largely submerged platform that
    stretches from Sumatra and Java on the southwest to the Philippines
    on the northeast, and is attached to India on the northwest; and (8)
    Greenland, which, though closely associated with North America, is
    partially separated by a rather deep depression.</p>

  <p><b>The depressed or master segments.—</b>The great sunken segments
    show a tendency to assume roughly polygonal, rather than triangular,
    forms. This accords with the primary place assigned them, since, in a
    spherical surface divided into larger and smaller segments, the major
    parts should be polygonal while the minor residual segments are more
    likely to be triangular. The major segments are (1) the Pacific, (2)
    the Indian, (3) the North Atlantic, and (4) the South Atlantic. These
    form the principal group, while (5) the Arctic deeps (not including
    the shallow epicontinental portions), (6) the Mediterranean, (7) the
    Caribbean, and (8) the chain of deep pits between the Philippine ridge
    and the Bornean platform, constitute a subordinate group.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span></p>

  <p>Each member of the minor group is an irregular chain of depressed pits
    rather than a single continuous deep, unless the Arctic depression, of
    which little is now known, proves an exception. They lie between the
    greater segments at what may be conceived to be points of <i>critical
    working relations</i>, and are accompanied by small elevated blocks.
    The Caribbean, the Mediterranean, and the Bornean regions are the seats
    of the greatest present volcanic and related activities.</p>

  <p>In a general view, there are then four great sunken quadrilaterals
    and four great elevated triangles, with minor attendants in each
    class. Lest fondness for simplicity and symmetry lead too far, we
    must hasten to observe that the <i>dimensions</i> are not alike in
    either class. The Pacific segment is more than twice the size of any
    other basin segment, and four times that of the North Atlantic. The
    Eurasian triangle is more than twice the average size of the other
    land segments, and nearly three times that of the South American.
    Nor is there any large common divisor of approximate accuracy. This
    is not at all strange if the earth be regarded as a body of somewhat
    heterogeneous composition which naturally shrank in rather irregular
    segments. On the other hand, this irregularity is somewhat strange
    if the earth has evolved from a very homogeneous and symmetrical,
    primitive, fluid state. It is also a serious consideration in any
    theory that appeals to crystalline form, or analogy, as in the doctrine
    of a tetrahedral earth.</p>

  <p>Roughly approximated in millions of square miles, the major depressed
    segments are as follows: the Pacific, 60, the Indian, 27, the South
    Atlantic, 24, and the North Atlantic, 14, leaving 8 for minor
    depressions. The elevated segments are Eurasian, 24, African, 12, North
    American, 10, and South American, 9, leaving 10 for the minor blocks.</p>

  <p>If these segments be regarded as the great integers of body-movement,
    two-thirds of them taking precedence in sinking and the other third
    in suffering distortion, it is easy to pass to the conception of
    sub-segments, moving somewhat differently from the main segments,
    so as to aid in their adjustment to one another, and thus to the
    conception of plateaus and deeps. It is easy also to pass to the
    conception of mutual crowding and crumpling at the edges of these
    segments, accompanied by fracture and slipping. These conceptions
    perhaps represent the true relations between the massive movements
    of the abysmal and continental segments, as well as the less massive
    plateau-forming movements and the mountain-forming distortions. The
    mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span> and plateaus are probably the incidental results of the
    great abysmal and continental readjustments.</p>

  <p>The great movements are probably to be attributed to stresses that
    gradually accumulated until they overcame the rigidity of the thick
    massive segments involved, and forced a readjustment. In accumulating
    these stresses, some local yielding on weak lines and at special
    points was an inevitable incident in distributing more equably the
    accumulating stresses. So, also, the first great readjustments probably
    left many local strains and unequal stresses which gradually eased
    themselves by warpings, minor faultings, etc., so that some minor
    movements were a natural sequence of the great movements. But there
    were doubtless many local and superficial causes, such as irregular
    gains and losses of heat, regional loading and unloading, solution,
    hydration, etc., that have caused local or regional movement, and which
    have little to do with the great deformations of the earth’s body. As
    implied above, the gentle, nearly constant movements probably fall
    mainly into a different category from the great periodic movements.
    Both will be considered further.</p>

  <p><b>The differential extent of the movements.—</b>Between the highest
    elevation of the land and the lowest depth of the ocean, there
    is a vertical range of nearly twelve miles. There may have been
    higher elevations, relatively, in past times, but probably not
    deeper depressions; and so, if we assume that the surface was once
    perfectly spheroidal, this may be taken as a maximum expression of
    <i>differential</i> movement, not <i>absolute</i> vertical movement.
    From the Thibetan plateau, where a considerable area exceeds three
    miles in height, to the Tuscarora deep, where a notable tract exceeds
    five miles in depth, the range is eight miles, which may fairly
    represent the vertical range of rather massive differential movement.
    From the average height of the continents to the average abysmal
    bottoms of the oceans the range is nearly three miles, which may be
    taken as the differential movement of the great segments. Under certain
    hypotheses of the origin and early history of the earth, to be sketched
    later, the surface is not assumed to have been perfectly spheroidal
    originally, and hence the present irregularities do not necessarily
    imply so great differential movement.</p>

  <p>If the protruding portions of the lithosphere were graded down and the
    basins graded up to a common level, this level would lie about 9000
    feet below the ocean-surface. This equated level is the best basis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
    of reference for relative segmental movements. Referred to this datum
    plane, the continents, having an area about half as great as that of
    the ocean depths, have been squeezed up relatively about two miles,
    and the basins have sunk about one mile from the ideal common plane.
    The total downward movement, representing the total shrinkage of the
    earth, is quite unknown from observation. It is probably very much
    greater than the differential movement, as will appear from theoretical
    considerations as we go on.</p>

  <p>The extent of the <i>lateral</i> movements has a peculiar interest,
    for it bears theoretically on the shrinkage of the earth. Every
    mile of descent of the crust represents 6 miles (6.28) shortening
    of the circumference. If the vertical movements were limited to the
    <i>relative</i> ones just named, the mile of basin descent would give
    but little more than 6 miles of surplus circumference for lateral
    thrust and crumpling. How far does this go in explaining the known
    facts? By measuring the folds of the Alps, Heim has estimated the
    shortening represented by them to be 74 miles.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Claypole estimated
    the shortening for the Appalachians in Pennsylvania, not including
    the crystalline belt on the east, at 46 miles;<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> McConnel placed
    that of the Laramide range in British America at 25 miles,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and
    LeConte that of the Coast range in California at 9 to 12 miles.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
    These estimates must be corrected for the thickening and thinning of
    the beds in the process of folding, for the composite character of the
    folds, and for the effects of shearing and faulting. These will in
    part tend to increase and in part to decrease the estimates. The first
    effect of horizontal thrust is to close up all crevices and compact the
    beds as much as they will stand without bending. A part of the unusual
    thickness which the beds of folded regions commonly show is probably
    due to this edgewise compression. In experiments on artificial strata
    made to illustrate foldings (<a href="#fig449a"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 449<i>a</i></a>), the thickening of the
    layers is a very appreciable part of the process, though probably
    natural beds do not thicken in equal proportion. After the beds have
    been closely folded and the thrust is athwart them, they are thinned
    and stretched on the limbs of the fold. How far this and other causes
    of extension offset initial compression is undetermined, and is
    differently estimated. It <span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>seems highly probable from the nature of the
    case that the edgewise compression which resulted from sustaining the
    full stress before the beds bent, was much greater than the crosswise
    compression on the limbs of the folds, which came into action only
    after the stress had been largely satisfied by folding.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Whatever the correction, and whatever the probable errors of the above
    estimates, the amount of shortening involved in folding is large. The
    estimates given are merely those for certain periods of folding, and
    represent only that portion of the compression of the circumference
    which was concentrated in a given mountain range. The whole shortening
    of a circumference is to be found by adding together all the transverse
    foldings on a given great circle, following it about the globe at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
    right angles to a given folded tract. In so doing, it will be seen that
    the belt does not usually cross more than one or two strongly folded
    tracts of the same age, from which it is inferred that the shortening
    on each great circle was largely concentrated in a few tracts running
    at large angles to each other, to accommodate the shrinkage of the
    globe in all directions. If the folding in a main range crossing
    any great circle is doubled, it will probably represent roughly the
    shortening for that entire circle for that age. If one is disposed
    to minimize the amount of folding, the estimate may perhaps be put
    roundly at 50 miles, on an entire circumference, for each of the great
    mountain-making periods. If, on the other hand, one is disposed to
    give the estimates a generous figure so as to put explanations to the
    severest test, he may perhaps fairly place the shortening at 100 miles,
    or even more. For the whole shortening since Cambrian times, perhaps
    twice these amounts might suffice, for while there have been several
    mountain-making periods, only three are perhaps entitled to be put
    in the first order, that at the close of the Paleozoic, that at the
    close of the Mesozoic, and that in the late Tertiary. The shortening
    in the Proterozoic period was considerable, but is imperfectly known.
    The Archean rocks suffered great compression in their own times, and
    probably shared in that of all later periods, and if their shortening
    could be estimated closely, it might be taken as covering the whole.
    Assuming the circumferential shortening to have been 50 miles during a
    given great mountain-folding period, the appropriate radial shrinkage
    is 8 miles. For the more generous estimate of 100 miles, it is 16
    miles. If these estimates be doubled for the whole of the Paleozoic and
    later eras, the radial shortening becomes 16 and 32 miles, respectively.</p>

  <h3>THE CAUSES OF MOVEMENT.</h3>

  <h4><i>General Considerations.</i></h4>

  <p>The volume of the earth is at all times dependent on two sets of
    antagonistic forces, (1) the attractive or centripetal, consisting of
    gravity and the molecular and sub-molecular attractions, and (2) the
    resistant forces—which are not necessarily centrifugal—consisting of
    heat and the resistant molecular and sub-molecular forces.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span></p>

  <h4>1. <i>The centripetal agencies.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Gravity.—</b>The most obvious of the concentrating forces is
    gravity, and in most questions relating to great segmental movements,
    it has been thought sufficient to consider gravity alone, but it is by
    no means certain that this does not lead to serious error. In studying
    the causes and effects of earth movements, it is necessary to consider
    both gravitational <i>energy</i> and gravitational <i>force</i>.
    Gravitational <i>energy</i> is greatest when the mass is most widely
    dispersed, and least when most concentrated. Gravitational <i>force</i>
    is greatest when the mass is most concentrated, and least when most
    dispersed. The gravitational energy of the earth matter was at its
    maximum when it was most widely diffused in the supposed nebulous
    condition. It will perhaps reach its minimum at some future period
    when the shrinkage shall reach its limit. In passing from an expanded
    condition to a more concentrated condition, potential energy, or
    energy of position, is transformed into other forms of energy, chiefly
    heat. The heat thus developed is an important factor in the earth’s
    dynamics. The total amount of gravitational energy involved in the
    earth’s evolution is unknown, for neither the maximum dispersion of
    the earliest state, nor the ultimate condensation, is known. It is
    not difficult, however, to compute the amount of transformation of
    gravitational energy into heat, or other forms of energy, during a
    given degree of condensation. If a mass equal to that of the earth
    were originally infinitely scattered, the gravitational energy given
    up by it in condensing into a homogeneous sphere of the earth’s
    present size would, if all transformed into heat, suffice to raise the
    temperature of an equal mass of water 8900° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> (Hoskins), or an equal
    mass of rock (specific heat of .2), 44,500° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> If the mass were more
    condensed toward the center, as is the actual case, the heat would be
    considerably greater. If the condensation toward the center followed
    the Laplacian law (<a href="#Page_564"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 564</a>), the heat would be sufficient to raise the
    earth mass 48,900° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>, assuming its specific heat to be .2, which
    is about the average specific heat of rock at the surface (Lunn). A
    further shrinkage of one mile would transform an additional amount of
    gravitational energy into heat about equal in amount to Tait’s estimate
    of the loss of heat from the surface of the earth in 100,000,000 years
    (see <a href="#Page_572"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 572</a>). If the radial shrinkage has been 32 miles, or even 16
    miles, the amount of heat generated is very much greater than the
    estimated loss from the surface.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span></p>

  <p>How much gravitational energy can possibly be transformed into heat and
    other forms of energy in the future, can only be computed by making
    assumptions as to the possible extent of further contraction, and that
    involves hypotheses as to the atomic and sub-atomic constitution of the
    earth’s matter, and its behavior under the prodigious pressures of the
    earth’s interior. All shrinkage develops added gravitational force and
    further tendency to shrinkage, which follows when the heat generated by
    the shrinkage is lost; and where the process may end, in a body of the
    dimensions of the earth, is beyond present determination. If there were
    no limit to the density that might be attained, it would be impossible
    to assign any limit to the energy that might be transformed. It has
    usually been assumed that contraction could not go on indefinitely
    because the atoms would come into actual contact, and prevent further
    increase of density. This conception rests on the recently prevalent
    hypothesis of the atomic constitution of matter; but the more recent
    hypotheses that substitute multitudes of revolving corpuscles or
    electrons for irreducible atoms, do not carry the same presumption of a
    rigorous limit to condensation. It is not therefore prudent to try to
    set such a limit, or to make it a feature in the dynamical doctrines
    of the earth. It is even less prudent to try to measure the limit of
    future conversion of the gravitational energy of the sun into heat, and
    so to set a limit to the habitability of the earth.</p>

  <p>The <i>force</i> of gravity may be defined as the effort of
    gravitational energy to change into other forms of energy. It is most
    familiarly expressed in terms of weight, which is the resultant of the
    gravitational force of the whole earth upon a given portion. Weight is
    determined by the distances and directions of the given portion from
    all parts of the attracting mass, the amount of the attraction being
    directly as the mass and inversely as the square of the distance,
    modified by the direction. It is greatest about 610 miles below the
    surface, where it is 1.0392 times that at the surface. Below this
    point it declines, and at the center it is zero. The sum total of the
    earth’s gravitative force at the present time is equivalent to about
    6 × 10<sup>21</sup> tons. This gives rise to a pressure of about 3,000,000
    atmospheres at the center of the earth.</p>

  <p>Gravitational force is also expressed in terms of the earth’s ability
    to accelerate the velocity of falling bodies at its surface, which is
    now approximately 32 feet per second. For certain purposes, the force
    of gravity may be better pictured by means of the velocity required
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span> overbalance it, which is 6.9 miles per second; e.g. a body shot
    away from the surface at a speed exceeding 6.9 miles per second, would
    escape from the control of the earth if the influence of the atmosphere
    and other bodies is neglected; while a body shot away at less than this
    speed would return to the earth.</p>

  <p><b>Molecular and sub-molecular attractions.—</b>In addition to gravity,
    there are at least three additional classes of attractive agencies
    whose laws appear to differ from those of gravity, viz. cohesion,
    chemical affinity, and sub-atomic attraction, using these terms in
    their comprehensive generic senses. The thought has been entertained
    that these might be reducible to forms of gravity in ulterior analysis,
    but it does not appear from existing evidence that the laws of their
    attractions are conformable to the Newtonian law of the inverse
    square of the distance, to which gravity conforms. Apparently the
    forces of the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic attractions increase
    at higher rates, and have individual peculiarities of action quite
    different from gravity. It would be of the utmost service to geological
    philosophy if these laws of molecular and sub-molecular attractions
    were firmly established, and could be applied to the conditions of
    heat and pressure under which the matter of the interior of the earth
    exists. In the absence of such determinations, we can do little more
    than recognize that the matter of the interior of the earth tends to
    condense itself by the aid of molecular and sub-molecular attractions,
    supplemental to the attraction of gravity.</p>

  <p><b>Cohesion and crystallization.—</b>The force of gravity between small
    bodies is exceedingly feeble, but it is cumulative, every particle in a
    mass attracting every other particle, so that in great masses the force
    becomes enormous. In cohesion, and probably in the other molecular and
    sub-molecular attractions, the particles attract very strongly the
    particles with which they are in close relations, but beyond minute
    distances their effects are insensible. The force of crystallization
    is felt for a very short distance from the crystal, and “mass action”
    is probably dependent on a function of similar kind, acting at a very
    small distance, but the range of these forces is very limited in
    comparison with that of gravity.</p>

  <p>Rock matter, as a rule, tends to become crystalline by the assembling
    of like molecules in systematic order. The general effect is
    condensation, though this is not universally the case, for in some
    instances the crystalline arrangement results in expansion. The
    crystallizing force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span> may be regarded as a specialized variety of
    cohesion which usually coöperates with gravity to produce increased
    density. In cases of expansion it seems clear that the organizing force
    does not act according to the law of gravity. The intensity of the
    force exhibited in the formation of ice illustrates the superiority of
    the molecular force over the gravitative force in small masses; but in
    a planet of ice of very moderate dimensions, the internal pressure of
    gravity would overcome the crystalline force, which illustrates the
    superiority of gravity in large masses.</p>

  <p>While the crystalline force may thus in exceptional cases operate
    against gravity, it is known that in most cases it not only operates
    with it, but is controlled by it, in this sense—that where a substance
    has two forms of crystallization, it will take the denser one when the
    pressure is great. The inference is that if the less dense form of
    crystallization takes place under slight pressure, and subsequently
    the pressure is greatly increased, the form of crystallization will
    change from the less to the more dense.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> It is probable that in
    general those forms of molecular arrangement will be assumed in the
    deep zones which give the greatest density, and this probably includes
    concretionary, colloidal, and other forms of aggregation, as well as
    crystallization.</p>

  <p><b>Diffusion.—</b>The same law probably holds relative to
    diffusion, though in a molecular sense diffusion is the opposite of
    crystallization, for in crystallization, like comes to like, while in
    diffusion the molecules distribute themselves among those of unlike
    nature. Diffusive action, quite familiar in gases and liquids, takes
    place to some extent in solids. The molecules of plates of gold and
    lead brought into intimate contact under pressure mutually diffuse
    among one another. So gases seem to be very generally diffused or
    “occluded” in rocks, though the nature of this relation is imperfectly
    determined. It is known that pressure upon gases promotes their
    diffusion through liquids and solids. It is inferred that pressure upon
    a solid tends to the diffusion of the entrapped gases within it, but it
    is not to be inferred from this that pressure upon rock promotes the
    absorption of gases into it, but rather the opposite. It is probable
    that great pressure with high heat promotes the diffusion of entrapped
    gases or other diffusible substances through the rock-mass, and at the
    same time tends to their extrusion along lines of least resistance; but
    this is an inference rather than a demonstration.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span></p>

  <p><b>Chemical combination.—</b>The general effect of chemical
    combination under pressure is greater density. In reversible reactions
    capable of conditions of chemical or physical equilibrium, pressure
    invariably favors the formation of the denser of any possible products.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-atomic forces.—</b>Recent investigation has made it probable
    that atoms are composite, embracing many exceedingly minute
    bodies—corpuscles or electrons—in a state of extremely high activity
    and possessed of marvelous energy notwithstanding their minuteness.
    This discovery possesses deep interest to the geologist because it
    seems to reveal sources of energy of almost incalculable potency, some
    portions of which at least are being constantly freed and added to
    the previously recognized supplies of energy. Attempts have been made
    during the past few decades to limit the habitable age of the earth,
    both retrospectively and prospectively, by the smallness of the sum
    total of energy derivable from gravity. In these estimates slight
    recognition has been given to the resources of molecular and atomic
    energy, and none at all to the possibilities of sub-atomic energy. It
    would be going quite too far to assume that these sub-atomic energies
    are all available for the perpetuation of habitable conditions on
    the earth or in the solar system, but we are doubtless justified in
    appealing to them as an offset to all dicta restricting the period
    of the earth’s habitability by supposed insufficiencies of energy
    deduced merely from the estimated resources of gravity. The banishment
    of the idea of the atom as a minute, incompressible, undecomposable
    sphere takes away the theoretical limit of compressibility, and by
    so doing cuts away the groundwork for assigning definite limits even
    to the resources of gravity, since, as already indicated, unlimited
    condensation gives theoretically unlimited transformation of the
    potential energy of gravity.</p>

  <p>While we must await with such patience as we can command the
    development of fuller knowledge concerning the nature and laws of the
    molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic energies, and their applicability to
    the activities resident in the interior of the earth, it is permissible
    even now to assume that, besides the simple compressive action of
    gravity, there are at work varied forms of molecular aggregation, of
    atomic combination, and perhaps of sub-atomic change, tending toward
    increased density, and that the ulterior limit of these processes is
    quite undetermined. The condensational forces are now restrained at
    certain temporary limits by the antagonistic resistant forces, some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
    which, such as heat, are the products of the condensational forces, and
    are gradually being dissipated, permitting further condensation. Where
    the process may ultimately end, we dare not attempt to say. On the
    other hand, we are not compelled to accept assigned limits that seem to
    be inconsistent with the phenomena which the earth actually presents.</p>

  <h4>2. <i>The resisting agencies.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Heat.—</b>The most familiar of the active agencies that resist
    condensation is heat. Upon this the existing volume of the earth is
    immediately dependent, in some large part at least. As this heat is
    dissipated, the earth shrinks. This shrinkage increases the force of
    gravity, and hence the internal pressure increases, and, if further
    compression takes place as the result of this increased pressure,
    additional heat is developed, which checks further condensation until
    it is dissipated. It is this kind of creative and self-checking action
    that determines the volume of great gaseous bodies like the sun. Though
    their matter is far from its ultimate density, and their self-gravity
    is enormous, they condense slowly, because, with every stage of
    condensation, heat is generated which antagonizes gravity and checks
    condensation, until at least a part of the heat is radiated away.
    As the force of gravity increases with every stage of condensation,
    the heat developed to hold it in check must increase, and hence the
    famous law of Lane, that a gaseous body like the sun grows hotter as
    it condenses. This law holds good while the body remains in a gaseous
    state in which the maintenance of the volume is essentially dependent
    on heat. When a body becomes liquid or solid, its volume is dependent
    in part on forms of resistance other than heat, and the force of the
    law is abated, though the principle still holds good. In small solids,
    the principle has little application, since the force of self-gravity
    is slight compared to the resisting forces, and very little new heat
    is generated as the body loses that which it has; but in large bodies,
    like the earth, where the condensational forces are enormous and the
    internal temperature is very high, it is not improbable that the heat
    generated at every stage of condensation is relatively large. It has
    been inferred by some students of the phenomena that the conditions
    in the interior of the earth are essentially those of gaseous matter,
    so far as molecular relations are concerned, because the temperatures
    are thought to be above the critical temperatures of the substances
    composing it. If this be true, the new heat generated with each stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
    of condensation is large. However this may be, it seems safe to infer
    that in so far as the volume of the interior mass is dependent on heat
    resistance, <i>the loss of existing heat leads to the generation of
      new heat</i>. The amount of this new heat must be enough, together
    with the residual heat and the other forces of resistance, to match
    the new condensational forces. The molecular and sub-molecular forces
    of resistance other than heat, are probably responsible for some large
    part of the resistance to the increased condensational force, but how
    much is not determined.</p>

  <p><b>All resistance perhaps due to motion.—</b>As now interpreted,
    the force of resistance of heat is due to the impact of the flying
    particles of the heated matter. The other forms of resistance to
    compression have not usually been interpreted in this way, but the
    tendency of recent investigation is to place them in the same dynamic
    class. A cold solid body offers resistance to compression that is in no
    obvious way dependent on heat motion. In small bodies this resistance
    is immeasurably greater than the self-gravity of the body. It is so
    great that it can only be partially overcome by any force which human
    ingenuity can bring to bear upon it. This form of resistance has thus,
    not unnaturally, come to be regarded as approximately immeasurable, and
    perhaps as grading into actual immeasurability, and as resting back
    upon the actual contact of irreducible atoms. But the recent researches
    which have developed grounds for the conception that even the atoms
    are composite, lead to the further conception that their resistance
    to compression is dependent on the movement of their constituent
    corpuscles or electrons. This encourages the broad conception that the
    whole of the resistance to compression arises from molecular, atomic,
    and sub-atomic <i>motions</i>, of which heat is merely one form.</p>

  <p>While all this is yet on the frontier of physical progress, these
    conceptions may well be recognized in framing interpretations of
    the agencies which determine the volume of the earth, and which
    control the changes that take place in it from age to age. The result
    of their combined action at any stage is <i>a state of temporary
      equilibrium</i> between gravity, aided by the molecular, atomic,
    and sub-atomic attractions, on the one hand, and heat, aided by the
    molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic resistances, on the other. The vital
    problem is to ascertain <i>the original condition of balance</i>
    between these antagonistic forces, and the changes which have affected
    that balance since. The original state of balance is necessarily a
    matter of hypothesis, and the best that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span> can be done at present is to
    picture as clearly as possible the different hypotheses that have been
    entertained, and the different consequences that logically flow from
    them. The most important factor in the case is the original amount and
    distribution of internal heat.</p>

  <h3>ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF ORIGINAL HEAT DISTRIBUTION.</h3>

  <p>The hypothetical modes of origin of the earth will be treated in the
    historical section. Suffice it here to say that one view is that the
    earth was once gaseous, passed thence into a liquid, and later into
    a solid state. Under this view, there are two hypotheses as to the
    original distribution of internal heat, dependent on the mode of
    solidification. According to the one, solidification began at the
    surface after convection had brought the temperature of the whole
    mass down nearly to the point of congelation; according to the other,
    solidification began at the center at a high temperature, because of
    pressure, and proceeded thence outwards. The former only has been much
    developed in the literature of the subject, though the latter is now
    generally regarded as the more probable.</p>

  <p>Another view of the globe’s origin is that the earth was built up
    gradually by the infall of matter, bit by bit, at such a rate that
    though each little mass became hot as a result of its fall, it cooled
    off before others fell on the same spot, the rain of matter not being
    fast enough to heat up the whole mass to the melting-point. Under this
    view, the internal heat arose chiefly from compression due to the
    earth’s gravity.</p>

  <p>A clear conception of the three hypotheses of thermal distribution
    which rest on these two views of the origin of the earth is important
    to the further discussion.</p>

  <p><b>1. Thermal distribution on the convection hypothesis.—</b>It was
    formerly the prevailing opinion that the molten condition of the
    earth persisted in the interior until after the crust had formed,
    and that solidification proceeded from the surface downwards. It was
    a natural corollary of this view that, previous to the beginning of
    solidification, convection stirred the liquid mass from center to
    circumference and equalized the temperature so that the whole mass
    cooled down equably until it approached the point of solidification
    and became too viscous for ready convection. The temperature should,
    therefore, have been nearly the same from center to surface at the
    stage just preceding incipient solidification. This conception forms
    the basis of most discussions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span> involving internal temperatures.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
    The famous studies of Lord Kelvin are based on the assumption of a
    uniform initial temperature of 7000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr><a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Other temperatures
    have been assumed in similar studies by others, but the results do not
    differ materially. On this hypothesis there would be no deep-seated
    change of temperature until a temperature-gradient, extending to the
    deeper horizons, had been developed by surface cooling. In the earliest
    eras, the loss of heat would be felt solely in the outer zone. By
    surface cooling, a temperature gradient would be slowly developed, and
    gradually changed from age to age, as shown by the curved lines in
    <a href="#fig450"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 450</a>, each of which shows the temperature at the successive stages
    stated in the legend. The computations for these curves were based
    on the methods and assumptions of Lord Kelvin. The two lower curves
    represent greater periods than those usually assigned by geologists to
    the whole history of the earth. It will be seen that the modification
    of the original temperature line extends only about 160 miles below the
    surface for the 100,000,000-year period, only about 240 miles for the
    237,000,000-year period, and only about 320 miles for the excessive
    period of 600,000,000 years. The superficial nature of the whole
    thermal problem under this hypothesis is thus made clear and impressive.</p>

    to indicate the original extension of the initial temperature to the
    surface. The upper curve at the right shows how much the temperature
    will have been modified at the end of 100,000,000 years, computed
    according to the method of Lord Kelvin. The middle curve shows the
    change at the end of 237,000,000 years, and the lower curve the change
    at the end of 600,000,000 years. Similar curves may be found in an
    article by Clarence King, Am. Jour. of Sci., XLV, 1893, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>After the outer shell had cooled so as to be in approximate equilibrium
    with the environment of the earth, it suffered practically no
    contraction.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span></p>

  <p>So also it appears from the diagram that there was practically no
    contraction below 160 miles up to the end of the 100,000,000-year
    period, because cooling had not yet reached that depth. Between these
    two non-contracting horizons the greatest rate of contraction at the
    close of the 100,000,000-year period lay about 60 miles below the
    surface. The contraction of this middle zone, while the outermost shell
    and the interior body remained constant, is held to have developed a
    state of horizontal thrust in the outer shell, because this shell,
    being too large for the shrinking subcrust, tended to settle, and
    to crowd upon itself horizontally. The wrinkling and other modes of
    deformation of the outer part of the earth are referred, under this
    view, to the thrust so developed. This is the view which has been most
    generally accepted.</p>

  <p><b>Level of no stress.—</b>As the outer shell is thus held to be in
    a state of thrust while the zone below is in a state of shrinkage,
    there must be, between these two zones, a <i>level of no stress</i>,
    where there is neither compression nor stretching. Above this level,
    the thrust increases to the surface, and below it, the stretching
    increases to the depth of most rapid change of temperature, below which
    it decreases and finally vanishes at the lower limit of temperature
    change. In the earliest stages of cooling, the level of no stress
    must have been near the surface, and must have descended gradually as
    the cooling proceeded. The depth of this level has been repeatedly
    computed on the basis of assumed times and rates of cooling. Fisher,
    assuming the temperature of solidification to have been 4000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>
    and the period of cooling 33,000,000 years, computed its depth at only
    ⁷⁄₁₀ of a mile below the surface.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> T. Mellard Reade, with somewhat
    different assumptions, placed it at 2 miles after 100,000,000 years
    of cooling.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Davison (1897) placed it at 2.17 miles,<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and G. H.
    Darwin at 2 miles after the same period.<a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> In a later computation,
    based on the assumption that the coefficient of dilatation increases
    with the temperature, Davison placed the level of no stress at 7.79
    miles, and stated that if the coefficient of conductivity and the
    initial heat also increased down wards, the zone would lie still
    deeper. To suppose the initial heat to increase downwards, however, is
    to abandon the hypothesis we are now considering. These computations
    seem to show that, at the very utmost, the level of no stress, under
    this hypothesis, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>lies at a very slight depth, and that the thrust zone
    above is, therefore, very shallow. This should be kept constantly in
    mind in all deductions drawn from this hypothesis. If the thickness
    of the thrust zone be taken at 8 or 10 miles, it will apparently be
    conceding to the view all that can legitimately be claimed for it.</p>

    temperatures of the earth when it first became solid, under the
    hypothesis that it solidified from the center outward, and assuming

    surface to 3,000,000 atmospheres at the center, derived from Laplace’s
    law of density. The upper curve, FC, represents the fusion-points of
    diabase at the various depths and pressures, and hence the temperatures
    at which the interior would become solid at the various depths, or,
    in other words, the initial temperatures of the solid earth. The
    lower curve is derived from Slichter; the upper is formed by directly
    plotting the temperatures given by Barus (Am. Jour. Sci., 1893, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7).</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>2. Thermal distribution on the hypothesis of central
    solidification.—</b>When the previous conception was first formed, the
    effect of pressure on the melting-points of lavas was neglected, as
    little or nothing was known on the subject. Experiment, however, has
    shown that pressure, as a rule, raises the melting-points of lavas, and
    out of this has grown the doctrine that the earth solidified first at
    the center, where the pressure was greatest, and gradually congealed
    outwards. Barus has shown that the melting-point of diabase,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
    selected as a representative rock, rises directly with the pressure.
    If this rate holds good to the center of the earth, the melting
    temperature of diabase there would be 76,000° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> (136,800°F.). The
    range of the experiment is, however, very small compared with the range
    of the application, and little confidence can be felt in the special
    numerical result reached. The rate of rise of the fusion-point may
    be much changed as the extraordinary conditions of the deep interior
    are invaded. Still there is good ground for the hypothesis that
    solidification took place at some very high temperature at the center,
    because of the very great pressure there. The inference then is that
    when the temperature of the center of the supposed molten globe reached
    the appropriate point, solidification began there, and that it took
    place at lesser depths in succession as the appropriate temperatures
    were reached. This view <i>excludes convection</i> in the successive
    zones from the center outward after the time when their temperatures
    of solidification were reached, or after these were approached
    sufficiently near to develop prohibitive viscosity. Some loss of heat
    from these horizons would be suffered while the outer parts were
    solidifying, but on account of the exceedingly slow conductivity of
    rock, it is improbable that the amount of loss would be sufficient
    to change the general character of the internal distribution of heat
    previous to solidification at the surface, the time when the existing
    phase of the earth’s history by hypothesis began. <a href="#fig451"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 451</a> shows the
    theoretical distribution of heat under this view. The consequences of
    this assumption are very important to geological theory and, carried
    out to their logical consequences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span> lead to the conclusion that cooling
    and shrinkage <i>affected the deep interior of the earth</i>, for the
    high central heat must have been constantly passing out toward the
    surface. Instead, therefore, of the contraction being concentrated
    in and limited to the outer 200 miles or so, as under the preceding
    hypothesis, it was deeply distributed. The contraction within the outer
    zone would be less than under the preceding view, because the flow
    of heat from within would partially offset the flow outwards, and a
    corresponding part of the contraction would be distributed below.</p>

  <p><b>3. Thermal distribution under the accretion hypothesis.—</b>The
    accretion hypothesis assumes that the internal heat was gradually
    developed from the center outwards as the earth grew and the internal
    compression was progressively developed. The heat, therefore, continued
    to rise at the center as long as compression continued, or at least
    as long as the compression was sufficient to generate heat faster
    than it was conducted outwards. As the conduction of heat through
    rock is exceedingly slow, the central heat may be assumed to have
    continued to rise so long as the infall of matter caused appreciable
    compression. In the same way, heat was generated progressively in
    the less central parts, and these parts also received the heat that
    passed out from beneath. It is assumed under this hypothesis that the
    degree of interior compression stands in close relation to interior
    density, for while there would probably be some segregation of heavier
    matter toward the center and of lighter toward the surface by means of
    volcanic action and internal rearrangement under stress differences,
    the interior density is regarded as due mainly to compression. The
    distribution of internal pressure and density generally accepted is
    that of Laplace, who assumed that the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>increase of the density varies
    as the square root of the increase of the pressure. This law gives a
    distribution of density that accords fairly well with the phenomena of
    precession of the equinoxes, which require that the higher densities
    of the interior shall be distributed in certain proportions between
    the center and the equatorial protuberance whose attraction by the sun
    and moon causes precession. The increases in pressure, density, and
    temperature have been computed as follows by Mr. A. C. Lunn,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> the
    average specific gravity of the earth being taken at 5.6, the surface
    specific gravity at 2.8, and the specific heat at .2.</p>

  <p>The temperatures are shown graphically in <a href="#fig452"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 452</a>, in which the
    curves of pressure and density are also given. The nature of the curve
    of temperature is such that, if the thermometric conductivity of the
    material is uniform at all depths, the temperature <i>will fall in
    the deeper portions and rise in the outer ones</i>, excluding the
    surface portions subject to outside cooling. The curve indicates that
    the rising temperature would affect somewhat more than 800 miles of
    the outer part of the spheroid, or about half its volume, i.e. the
    inner half during the initial period had a falling temperature and the
    outer half, except the immediate surface, a rising temperature. This
    introduces a very singular feature into the problem, for the outer
    zone must shrink to fit the inner portion that is losing heat, while
    its own material is expanding because of its increase of temperature.
    A double distortional effect must result.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> If the conductivity of
    the dense interior is greater than that of the outer parts, the effect
    is intensified. The redistribution of heat resulting from this unequal
    flowage would in time change the curve so that more nearly equal
    flowage would result. It would probably take a very long period for
    this to be effected, on account of the very slow conductivity of rock.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span></p>

  <p>The accretion hypothesis assumes that, during the growth of the
    earth, large amounts of heat were carried by volcanic action from
    deeper horizons to higher ones and to the surface, and that this
    still continues at a diminished rate. It assumes that whenever the
    interior heat raised any constituent of the interior matter above
    its fusing-point under the local pressure, it passed into the liquid
    state, <i>and was forced outwards by the stress differences to which
    it was subjected</i>, unless its specific gravity was sufficiently
    high to counterbalance them. It is conceived that the more fusible
    portions were liquefied first, and that in so doing they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span> absorbed the
    necessary heat of liquefaction and began to work their way outward,
    carrying their heat into higher horizons and temporarily checking the
    development of more intense stresses in the lower horizons. They thus
    served to keep the temperature there below the fusion-point of the
    remaining more refractory substances. Meanwhile the extruded portions
    were raising the temperatures of the higher horizons into which
    they were intruded or through which they were forced to pass. There
    was thus, it is thought, an automatic action that tended to reduce
    the heat-curve to the fusion-curve. <i>The actual curve of internal
    temperature may, therefore, be practically the fusion-curve.</i> This
    is identical with the curve supposed to arise from solidification by
    pressure from the center outward under the molten hypothesis, except
    so far as the two would vary as the result of variations in the
    distribution of matter, which would not be quite the same under the two
    hypotheses. The curve of fusion deduced by an extension of the results
    of Barus’ experiment has been given. It is necessary to recognize
    that the rate of rise of the fusion-point may, and very likely
    does, change in the deep interior. The curve given represents much
    higher temperatures in the central parts than those given by Lunn’s
    computations from compression, which seem inherently more probable than
    the higher ones.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="fig452">
    <img class="illowp95" src="images/fig452.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="hang"><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr></span> 452.—Diagram illustrating the distribution
    of temperature under the accretion hypothesis (neglecting the heat from
    infall and other external sources). The divisions of the base-line
    represent fractions of the earth’s radius. The vertical divisions
    represent both pressure in megadynes per sq. cm., nearly the same as
    atmospheres per sq. in., at the left, and temperatures in degrees <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>
    at the right. It is to be noted that the temperature scale is 2000°
    <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> per division, while that of <a href="#fig451"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 451</a> is 5000° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> per division. The
    upper curve at the left, PC, is the pressure curve. The middle curve,
    DC, is the density curve, beginning at 2.8 at the surface and reaching
    nearly 11 at the center. The lower curve, TC, is the temperature curve,
    rising from the surface temperature, 0° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>, at the right, to 20,000° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>
    at the center. It is to be noted that the portion of this curve at the
    left representing the deeper part of the earth is convex upwards, while
    the portion at the right is concave. It will be seen that the gradient
    increases from the center to a point between .6 and .7 radius, and then
    decreases, and that between .8 radius and the surface, a distance of
    about 800 miles, the decrease is notable. This means that with an equal
    coefficient of conductivity the flow from the center outward to .6 or
    .7 radius will be faster than the flow from .8 radius to the surface,
    neglecting the immediate surface effects of external cooling. These
    curves were worked out by Mr. Lunn.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>As astronomical and seismic evidences strongly favor the view that
    the earth is rigid throughout, they lend support to the view that
    the interior retains its rigidity by the extrusion of liquid matter
    practically as fast as it is formed, and that this progressive
    extrusion adjusts the temperature to that which is consistent with
    solidity.</p>

  <p>The bearing of this conception becomes evident on consideration. The
    shrinkage of the earth from loss of heat by conduction and by the
    extrusion of molten rock, affects the deep interior as well as the
    more superficial zones. <i>It is even possible that the shrinkage may
    originate chiefly in the deeper zones.</i> The postulated transfer of
    fluid rock from the deeper parts to the more superficial ones lessens
    the heat in the former, and adds to that in the latter. The postulated
    greater flow of heat from the deeper half to the outer half, than from
    the latter outward, gives a concordant result. If the conductivity
    of the deeper and denser material is appreciably greater than that
    of the more superficial and less dense material, as seems probable,
    this effect is intensified. The distribution of compressibility at
    the existing state of condensation may possibly be such that more
    new heat is generated by shrinkage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span> in the outer parts than in the
    inner. Neither of these conceptions can be affirmed as actually taking
    place. They merely lie within the range of reasonable hypothesis in
    the present state of experimental data. What the real truth is must be
    left to further research. Present effort may be regarded as temporarily
    successful if it forms consistent conceptions of the applicable
    hypotheses, and of their consequences.</p>

  <p><b>Recombination of material.—</b>One other peculiarity of the
    accretion hypothesis must be recalled here. The incoming bodies must
    probably be assumed to have fallen in promiscuous order, and hence
    to have been indiscriminately mingled in the growing earth. As they
    became buried deeper and deeper and their temperatures and pressures
    were raised, much recombination, chemical and physical, may be presumed
    to have followed. As already noted, these changes would probably give
    increased density in the main. The material being, however, in a
    solid state, the rearrangement would be slow and its persistence in
    time indeterminate, and it may yet be far from complete. It is not
    improbable, therefore, under this hypothesis, that some notable part
    of the recent shrinkage of the earth has been due to the continued
    rearrangement of its heterogeneous internal matter. This would not be
    equally so in an earth derived from a molten mass, for the required
    adjustments of the material should have taken place while in the fluid
    state before solidification.</p>

  <p><b>Comparison of the hypotheses.—</b>By comparing the three hypotheses
    of the early states of the earth’s temperature, it will be seen that
    there is a radical difference, thermally, between the first and
    the last two. The first assumes a nearly uniform distribution of
    internal temperature, and hence, owing to the exceedingly slow rate
    of conduction, limits the movements and deformations of the crust, so
    far as dependent on heat, to very superficial horizons. The second and
    third views agree in postulating changes of temperature in the deep
    portions, as well as in the superficial, and hence involve the central
    portion of the earth in the great movements and deformations. It is not
    to be supposed that this of itself necessarily increases the sum-total
    of the effects of contraction, for, given a certain loss of heat from
    the surface, it may be relatively immaterial whether this loss arose
    from a large reduction of temperature in a shallow zone, or a small
    reduction of temperature in a deep zone, for, except as the coefficient
    of expansion varies, the total shrinkage would be the same. But <i>the
    difference in distribution</i> makes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span> radical difference in the
    resulting movements, for, in the first case, the movements are in a
    weak superficial shell that cannot accumulate great stresses, and hence
    must yield practically as fast as the stresses arise, while, in the
    second case, the stress-accumulating power of the thick segments may be
    great, and the stresses may gather for long periods and give rise to
    great cumulative results at long intervals. In this respect the last
    two views have much in common, though they differ in other important
    particulars.</p>

  <p>With this general background of hypothesis, we may now turn to the
    direct evidences of the distribution of internal temperature which
    observations near the surface afford. Unfortunately they are limited to
    a mere film, as it were, little more than ¹⁄₄₀₀₀ of the radius of the
    earth.</p>

  <h3>OBSERVED TEMPERATURES IN EXCAVATIONS.</h3>

  <p>As the earth is penetrated below the zone of seasonal changes by wells,
    mines, tunnels, and other excavations, the temperature is almost
    invariably found to rise. The rate of rise, however, is far from
    uniform. If we set aside as exceptional the unusually rapid rise near
    volcanoes and in other localities of obvious igneous influence, the
    highest rates are still six times the lowest. A large number of records
    have been collated by the Committee on Underground Temperatures, of the
    British Association for the Advancement of Science. These range from
    1° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> in less than 20 feet to 1° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> in 130 feet, with an average of 1°
    <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> in 50 to 60 feet, which has usually been taken as representative.
    The more recent deep borings that have been carefully measured with due
    regard to sources of error indicate a slower rate of rise. Some of the
    more notable records are as follows:<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

  <p>It is to be noted that even these selected records vary a hundred per
    cent. Very notable variations are found in the same mine or well, and
    often much difference is found in adjacent records, especially those of
    artesian wells. Some of these are explainable, but the full meaning of
    other variations is yet to be found.</p>

  <p><b>Explanations of varying increment.—</b>Certain apparent variations
    are merely due to <i>inequalities of topography</i>. The isogeotherms,
    or planes of equal underground temperature, do not normally rise and
    fall with every local irregularity of the surface, but more nearly
    strike an average. A well on a bluff 500 feet high would probably reach
    nearly the same temperature at 1000 feet, as a well 500 feet deep in
    the adjacent valley, giving a gradient twice as great in the one case
    as in the other.</p>

  <p>In interpreting the temperatures of artesian flows, regard must be had
    to the <i>depths of rock under which the waters have passed</i>, as
    well as the depths at the location of the wells. Darton has found<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
    unusually high and varying temperatures in the artesian wells of the
    Dakotas, some part of which may be due to this cause, though a full
    explanation of their singular variations is not yet reached.</p>

  <p><b>The permeation and circulation of water</b> affect the temperature
    in two important ways: (1) wet rocks are better conductors than dry
    ones, and (2) the convective movement of water is a means of conveying
    heat from lower to higher horizons. As the circulation of underground
    water is very unequal, much irregularity of thermal distribution in
    the upper zones probably arises from this source. The <i>general</i>
    effect of water circulation is to reduce the thermal gradient where
    the circulation is relatively rapid, as it is near the surface and in
    the main thoroughfares of circulation, and hence to cause a relatively
    rapid rise in the gradient just below the zone of effective water
    influence. Some records conform to this theoretical deduction, but in
    general it is masked by other influences.</p>

  <p><b>Chemical action</b>, especially oxidation, carbonation, hydration,
    solution, and precipitation, modify the normal temperature gradient,
    but how effectively is not well determined. With little doubt the
    first three mentioned above raise the temperature, while solution
    and precipitation in some large measure offset each other.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The
    sum-total<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span> is probably an appreciable rise in temperature. It has even
    been conjectured that the heat of volcanic action is due to chemical
    combination in the lower reaches of water circulation, but this is
    obviously an over-estimate.</p>

  <p><b>Differences in the conductivity of rock</b> are an obvious source
    of varying underground temperature gradients. If an outer formation
    conducts heat more freely than those below, it tends to lower the
    gradient within itself and to cause a relative rise in the gradient
    just below. If a lower formation is more conductive than that above, it
    tends to lower the gradient within itself, and to raise it in the one
    above, because it carries heat to the outer one faster than the latter
    carries it away.</p>

  <p>The <b>compression</b> to which rocks have been subjected affects their
    temperature. At the surface the variation from this source is chiefly
    dependent on the lateral thrust suffered.</p>

  <p>When allowances are made for all these and other known causes of local
    variation of temperature, it is still not clear that a uniform average
    gradient remains as the true conception. If the earth were once a
    molten spheroid, there would be a strong presumption that, aside from
    local variations, there would be a normal curve applicable to all
    regions. On the other hand, if the internal heat has arisen chiefly
    from compression, and if the compression has varied in different
    regions, as the inequalities of the surface render probable, there
    would be no such definite normal curve in the accessible zone of the
    earth, but rather a varying rate in different regions. In either case,
    the later movements, compressions and strains of the crust, must modify
    the original thermal gradients.</p>

  <p><b>Gradients projected.—</b>It is not probable that these gradients,
    even when corrected for local variations, continue unmodified to the
    center of the earth. If they did, 1° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> in 60 feet continued to the
    earth’s center would give 348,000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr>, and 1° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> in 100 feet would
    give 209,000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> It is much more probable that the rates of rise fall
    away below the superficial zone. If water circulation in the fracture
    zone is the most efficient agency cooperating with conductivity in the
    outward conveyance of heat, as seems probable, the gradient in that
    zone should rise at an abnormal rate, and hence the average gradient
    in the deeper portions not affected by this circulation should be
    lower. It will be recalled that the central temperature deduced from
    an extension of Barus’ fusion curve is 136,800° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> (76,000° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>),
    which, high as it is, gives a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span> lower average gradient than the surface
    observations. The computations from compression by Lunn, giving a
    central temperature of 36,000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> (20,000° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>), imply a still lower
    average rate, while the convection hypothesis postulates no sensible
    increase at all below 200 or 300 miles.</p>

  <p><b>The amount of loss of heat.—</b>The amount of loss of interior heat
    which the earth suffers may be estimated by that which is observed to
    be passing outward through the rock, or by computing the amount which
    should be conveyed outwards with the estimated gradients and with the
    conductivity of rock as determined by experiment. The latter method
    is usually employed in general problems. Taking the mean thermometric
    conductivity of rock as 0.0045, the gradient as 1° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> in 30 meters,
    the average specific heat of rock as 0.5 small calories per cubic
    centimeter, it is computed that in 100,000,000 years the loss of heat
    would amount to 45° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> (81° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr>) for the whole body of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
    Tait makes the more conservative estimate of 10° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> (18° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr>) in the
    same period.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> This is an exceedingly small result, and emphasizes
    the low conductivity of rock.</p>

  <p><b>The amount of shrinkage from loss of heat.—</b>To compute the amount
    of shrinkage for a given amount of cooling, the average coefficient of
    expansion of rock is required. This has been experimentally determined
    by several investigators. By combining the determinations of others
    with his own, T. Mellard Reade found the <i>linear</i> coefficient
    to be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span>.000005257 per 1° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr>, equivalent to .00002838 per 1° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> per
    <i>volume</i>. In this the proportions of the different rocks in the
    crust were roughly estimated. To secure an independent result from the
    best available estimate of what constitutes the average rock, W. H.
    Emmons has reduced Clarke’s average of the chemical constituents of
    the crust to the norm minerals under the new system of Cross, Iddings,
    Pirsson, and Washington (see <a href="#Page_454"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 454</a>) and made a weighted average of the
    conductivities of these, as shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>Subtracting the stated volume from the volume at a temperature of 1°
    <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> higher, the difference is found to be .0006708125, which divided by
    the volume gives .0000199, which is the coefficient of expansion of the
    theoretical, average, surface rock of the earth.</p>

  <p>With this coefficient, the radial shrinkage resulting from an average
    loss of 10° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> (18° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr>), (Tait’s estimate), is a little over a quarter
    of a mile (.2572); and for a loss of 45° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> (81° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr>), (estimate of
    Daniell’s Physics), a little over a mile (1.1574). The shortening of
    the circumference for 10° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> loss is 1.6 miles, and for 45° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>, 7.27
    miles. Computations based on the coefficient of expansion adopted by
    Reade give 2.35 miles circumferential shortening for a loss of 10° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>
    and 10.5 miles for a loss of 45° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> In both these cases, the whole
    contraction is assumed to take a vertical direction, and hence these
    are maximum results. They are exceedingly small.</p>

  <p>Unless there is a very serious error in the estimated rate of thermal
    loss, or in the coefficients of expansion, cooling would seem to be a
    very inadequate cause for the shrinkage which the mountain foldings,
    overthrust faults, and other deformations imply. This inadequacy has
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span>been strongly urged by Fisher<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and by Dutton.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> In view of the
    apparent incompetency of external loss of heat, the possibilities of
    distortion from other causes invite consideration.</p>

  <h3>OTHER SOURCES OF DEFORMATION.</h3>

  <p><b>Transfer of internal heat.—</b>It is theoretically possible that
    deformation of the subcrust may result from the internal transfer of
    heat without regard to external loss. It has already been shown (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
    539) that under certain possible conditions more heat would flow from
    the inner parts to higher horizons than would be conveyed through
    these latter to the surface and there lost, and that, as a result,
    the temperatures of the inner parts might be falling, while those of
    the outer parts (except the surface) might be rising. With the more
    conservative coefficient of expansion previously given, a lowering of
    the average temperature of the inner half of the earth 500° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr> and the
    raising, by transfer, of the outer half to an equal amount would give a
    lateral thrust of about 83 miles, which is about the order of magnitude
    thought to be needed. It is not affirmed that this takes place, but
    some transfer of this kind is among the theoretical possibilities under
    the accretion hypothesis. The process could not continue indefinitely;
    but, for aught that can now be affirmed, it may still be in progress.</p>

  <p><b>Denser aggregation of matter.—</b>As already noted, matter under
    intense pressure tends to aggregate itself in the forms that give the
    greatest density. If the earth were built up of heterogeneous matter
    arranged at haphazard, the material would probably readjust itself more
    or less, as time went on, into combinations of greater and greater
    density. This process may be one of the important sources of shrinkage,
    for an average change of density of 1 percent., affecting the matter
    of the whole globe, would probably meet all the demands of deformation
    since the beginning of the Paleozoic period.</p>

  <p><b>Extravasation of lavas.—</b>It is obvious that if lavas are forced
    out from beneath the crust and spread upon it, a compensating sinking
    of the crust will follow. This, however, is rather a mode than an
    ulterior cause, for a cause must be found for the extrusion of the
    lavas, and this cause may be one of the other agencies recognized,
    such as a transfer of heat, a reorganization of matter, or a change
    of pressure. The more <span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span>practical question, however, relates to its
    competency. Can the amount of lava that has been extruded have had
    any very appreciable effect on the descent of the crust? The great
    Deccan flow is credited with an area of 200,000 square miles, and a
    thickness of 4000 to 6000 feet. Vast as this is for a lava-flow, it
    would form a layer only about 5 feet thick when spread over the whole
    surface of the globe, and hence the sinking to replace it would cause
    a lateral thrust, on any great circle, of about 31 feet only. It
    requires a very generous estimate of the lavas poured out between any
    two great mountain-making periods since the beginning of the well-known
    stratigraphic series to cause a horizontal thrust of any appreciable
    part of that involved in mountain-making. The case is different,
    however, if we go back to the Archean era, in which the proportion of
    extrusive and intrusive rocks is very high. Very notable distortion may
    then be assigned to the extravasation of lavas. The outward movement
    of lava must also be credited with some transfer of heat from lower to
    higher horizons, and this is probably one of the agencies that have
    produced the relatively high underground temperatures in the outer part
    of the earth.</p>

  <p>If lavas are thrust into crevices of the crust they contribute to its
    extension, but causes for the crevices and for the intrusion must be
    found, and these are probably only expressions of one or another of the
    more general agencies.</p>

  <p><b>Change in the rate of rotation.—</b>As previously noted, the tide
    acts as a brake on the rotation of the earth. The oblateness of the
    present earth is accommodated to its present rate of rotation. It is
    assumed that such accommodation has always obtained, and that if the
    rotation has changed, the form of the earth has changed also. Now, the
    more oblate the spheroid, the larger its surface shell and the less the
    total force of gravity. Hence if the earth’s rotation has diminished,
    its crust must have shrunk, because the form of the spheroid has
    become more compact, and the increase of gravity has increased its
    density. There is at present a water-tide chiefly generated in the
    southern ocean, and irregularly distributed to more northerly waters.
    This irregularity interferes with its systematic action as a brake,
    and its average effects are difficult of estimation. The water-tides
    of past ages are still more uncertain, as they must have depended on
    the configuration and continuity of the oceans. There are geological
    grounds for the belief that the southern ocean was interrupted by land
    during portions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span> of the past at least, and it is unknown whether there
    were elsewhere ocean-belts well suited to the generation of large
    tides. The ocean-tide, therefore, furnishes a very uncertain basis
    for estimating the retardation of rotation.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The theoretical case
    rests largely on the assumption of an effective body-tide. The earth
    doubtless has some body-tide, but whether it is sufficiently great to
    be effective, and whether its position, which depends on its promptness
    in yielding and in resilience, is favorable to the retardation of
    rotation, are yet open questions. The existence of an appreciable
    body-tide has not yet been proved by observation.</p>

  <p>G. H. Darwin, assuming that the earth is viscous enough to give a
    body-tide of appreciable value and of effective position, has deduced
    a series of former rates of rotation of the earth and has computed the
    corresponding distances of the moon.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> C. S. Slichter has shown that
    the lessening of the area of the surface and the increase of the force
    of gravity corresponding to these assigned changes of rotation are
    large, and that if the changes were actually experienced they must have
    involved much distortion of the crust.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> These distortions would,
    however, be of a peculiar nature, and should thereby be detectible, if
    they were realized; for in passing from a more oblate to a less oblate
    spheroid, the equatorial belt shrinks, and the polar tracts rise and
    become more convex. Wrinkles should, therefore, mark the equatorial
    belts, and tension the high latitudes. Slichter has computed that in
    a change from a rotation period of 3.82 hours to the present one, the
    equatorial belt must shorten 1131 miles and the meridional circles
    lengthen 495 miles. If we take Heim’s estimate of the crust-shortening
    involved in forming the Alps—74 miles—as a standard, the 1131 miles
    of equatorial shortening would be sufficient for the formation of 15
    mountain ranges of Alpine magnitude. If, as some geologists urge, the
    estimate of mountain folding is too great, the quotient would be still
    larger. These ranges should run across the equator and be limited to
    about <span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span>33° N. and S. latitude. The high-latitude tension would be
    sufficient to cause the earth to gape more than two hundred miles at
    the poles, if there were simple ideal shrinkage. The amounts and the
    distribution of thrust and shrinkage are shown in <a href="#fig453"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 453</a>. If the
    change of rotation were no more than from 14 hours to the present rate,
    there would still be 52 miles of thrust in the equatorial belt, and
    40 miles of shortage in the meridional circles. There are no clear
    signs of such a remarkable distribution of thrust and tension as this
    hypothesis requires. Mountains are about as abundant and as strong
    north of 33°, the neutral line, as south of it, and they extend to
    high latitudes. The Archean rocks, in which this agency should have
    been most effective because of their early formation, are crumpled
    and crushed in the high latitudes much the same as in low latitudes.
    Furthermore, if there had been appreciable change in the form of the
    earth to accommodate itself to a slower rotation, the water on the
    surface, being the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span> mobile element, should have gathered toward
    the poles, and the less mobile solid earth should have protruded about
    the equator, but the distribution of land and water, present and past,
    gives no clear evidence of this. The equatorial belt contains a less
    percentage of land than the area north of it and more than that south
    of it. It varies but slightly from the average for the whole globe.</p>

  <p>While the doctrine of tidal retardation is theoretically sound, and
    while the relations of the moon to the earth have probably been
    appreciably affected by tidal action, geological evidence indicates
    that it has not been sufficiently effective in producing crustal
    deformations to be clearly detected by its own distinctive results.
    This may be due (1) to the fact that there are compensating agencies
    that tend to acceleration of rotation, and (2) to the probable fact
    that the central rigidity of the earth is too high to give a very
    effective body-tide. Hence the process of retardation may have been too
    slow to have been geologically appreciable in the known period. The
    recent estimates of the effective rigidity of the earth are greater
    than former ones, and they may need to be modified yet further in the
    same direction.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution of rigidity.—</b>An important consideration in this
    connection is the distribution of interior rigidity. It is certain
    that the rigidity of the outermost part, taken as a mass, is somewhat
    less than that of rock of an average surface type, for it is fissured,
    and there is no reason to suppose that the rigidity of the rock next
    below the fissure zone rises at once to the rigidity of steel, and
    hence if the average rigidity of the whole earth is equal to that of
    steel, a portion of the interior must have a rigidity much higher than
    steel. There is probably some law of increase from surface to center,
    and there are theoretical grounds for thinking that it is in some way
    connected with the laws of pressure, density, compressibility, and
    temperature. All of these factors probably affect rigidity, but in
    different ways. The modulus of rigidity of steel is about 770 × 10<sup>6</sup>
    grms. per sq. cm. Milne and Gray<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> found that of granite to be 128 ×
    10<sup>6</sup>. The ratio of the rigidity of steel to that of rock is, therefore,
    about 6 : 1. If it be assumed that the rigidity increases in depth
    directly as the density, the rigidity will nowhere reach that of steel,
    being only about two-thirds as much at the center. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>If it be assumed
    that the rigidity increases as the squares of the density ratios, the
    following values are obtained:</p>

  <p>These values seem fairly consistent with the apparent requirements of
    the case.</p>

  <p>If the distribution of rigidity were of this nature, the <i>average</i>
    rigidity would be much less than that of steel, for more than half
    the volume lies in the outer division, between 1.00 and .75 radius,
    and yet the effective resistance to tidal deformation would be high,
    for, according to G. H. Darwin,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> the tidal stress-differences are
    eight times as great in the center as at the surface. The rigidity
    would, therefore, be distributed so as to be much more effective
    in resistance than if it were uniform. The suggestion arises here
    that the tidal stresses and other analogous stresses arising from
    astronomical sources may be in themselves the causes of some such
    distribution of rigidity as this. The tidal stresses are rhythmical
    and give rise to a kind of kneading of the body of the earth, small in
    measure to be sure, but persistent and rapidly recurrent. Since these
    stress-differences at the center are eight times those at the surface,
    and since also the gravitative stress at the center is 3,000,000 times
    that at the surface, there is a series of persistently recurring
    stress-differences, greatest at the center and declining outwards,
    superposed on enormous static stresses, also intensest at the center
    and declining outwards. Now, if the earth material were once made up
    of a mixture of minerals of different fusibility, some of which became
    more mobile (whether fluid or viscous) than others under the rising
    temperature of the interior, it seems that the more mobile portion must
    have tended to move from the regions of greater stress-differences to
    those of lesser stress-differences. The persistence and the rhythmical
    nature of the tidal stress-differences seem well suited to aid the
    mobile parts in gradually working their way outwards. At the same time
    the more solid and resistant portions should remain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span>behind, and thus
    come to constitute the dominant material of the central regions where
    stress-differences were greatest, and so, as it were, concentrate
    rigidity there. The process may still be in action.</p>

  <p>If it be assumed that the rhythmical stresses have thus developed a
    resistance to deformation proportional to their intensity, we may
    combine this with density to form the basis of another hypothetical
    distribution of rigidity, as follows:</p>

  <p>The average rigidity is here also much less than that of steel, but its
    distribution is such as to render it ideally fitted to resist tidal
    distortion.</p>

  <p>These hypothetical distributions of rigidity have no claims to special
    value in themselves, for the grounds on which they are based are quite
    inadequate, but they are not without importance in giving tangible form
    to considerations that bear vitally not only on tidal problems, but on
    many others connected with the internal constitution and dynamics of
    the earth.</p>

  <h4><i>Sphericity as a factor in deformation.</i></h4>

  <p>It is obvious that if the earth shrinks, its crust must become too
    large for the reduced spheroid, and must be compressed or distorted
    to fit the new form. The amount of distortion required for any given
    shrinkage is easily computed from the ratio of the radius to the
    circumference of a sphere, which is approximately 1 : 6.28. If, for
    example, the radius shortens 5 miles, each great circle must on the
    average be compressed, wrinkled, or otherwise distorted to the extent
    of about 31 miles, or, in reversed application, if the mountain
    foldings on any great circle together show a shortening of 100 miles,
    the appropriate radial shortening is 16 miles. The ratio of 1 : 6+
    furnishes a convenient check on hypotheses that assign specific thrusts
    to specific sinkings of adjacent segments. A segment 3000 miles across,
    for example, such as the bottom of the North Atlantic basin, sinking
    three miles, about the full depth of the basin, would give a lateral
    thrust of about 2.2<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span> miles, a little over a mile on each side, a
    trivial amount compared with the foldings on the adjacent continental
    borders.</p>

  <p><b>The influence of the domed form of the surface.—</b>Because of the
    spheroidal form of the earth, each portion of the crust is ideally an
    arch or dome. When broad areas like the continents are considered, it
    is the dome rather than the arch that is involved, and in this the
    thrust is ideally toward all parts of the periphery. It is probably for
    this reason that mountain ranges so often follow curved or angulated
    lines, or outline rude triangles or polygons. The sigmoidal courses
    of the ranges of southern Europe, the looped chains of the eastern
    border of Asia, and the curved ranges of the Antillean region, are
    notable examples. The border ranges of the Americas, of the Thibetan
    plateau, and of other great segments, illustrate the polygonal
    tendency. The general distribution of the great ranges is such that a
    nearly equal portion of crustal crumpling is thrown across each great
    circle, as theory demands. The common generalization that mountain
    ranges run chiefly in oblique directions, as northeast-southwest,
    northwest-southeast, is but a partial view of the more general fact
    that the lines of distortion must lie in all directions to accommodate
    the old crust to the new geoid, if there be equable contraction in all
    parts.</p>

  <p><b>Theoretical strength of domes of earth-dimensions.—</b>As the
    domed form of the crust has played an important part in theories of
    deformation, it is important to form quantitative conceptions of the
    strength of ideal domes having the figure and dimensions of segments
    of the earth’s crust. According to Hoskins,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> a dome corresponding
    perfectly to the sphericity of the earth, formed of firm crystalline
    rock of the high crushing strength of 25,000 pounds to the square
    inch, and having a weight of 180 pounds to the cubic foot, would, if
    unsupported below, sustain <i>only</i> 1⁄525 <i>of its own weight</i>.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
    This result is essentially independent of the extent of the dome, and
    also of its thickness, provided the former is continental and the
    latter does not exceed a small fraction of the earth’s radius. If this
    ideal case be modified by supposing the central part of the spherical
    dome to rise above the average surface, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span>the supporting power will not
    be materially changed unless the central elevation is a considerable
    fraction of the radius of the dome. Assuming a central elevation of
    two miles—to represent the protrusion of the continental segments—the
    results for domes of different horizontal extent are as follows:<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

  <p>From this table it will be seen that for domes of continental
    dimensions the supporting strength <i>equals only a very small fraction
    of the dome’s own weight</i>. Increasing the thickness of the shell
    increases its actual supporting power, but the proportion is somewhat
    less when the whole sphere is concerned. The problem has not been
    worked out for domes of limited extent. For rough estimates, where
    the dimensions of the dome are of continental magnitude, each mile of
    thickness may be taken as supporting a layer of about 10 feet of its
    own material. If the hypothetical level of no stress be placed at 8
    miles depth, the shell above this, by reason of its domed shape, could
    relieve its own pressure on that below to an amount equal only to the
    weight of about 80 feet of rock over its surface, even if its form and
    structure were ideal. If the shell were thick enough (817 miles) to
    embrace one-half the volume of the earth, its supporting power would
    be a little more than the weight of one and one-half miles of rock. As
    the radius of the earth is less than 4000 miles, the extreme supporting
    power reckoned on this basis would be only about 8 miles of rock-depth.
    It is interesting, if not significant, to observe that this depth
    barely reaches the minimum shrinkage that will serve, according to
    current estimates, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>to account for the crustal shortening of the great
    mountain-making periods. It is as if the shrinkage stresses accumulated
    to the full extent of the stress-resisting power of the whole sphere,
    and then collapsed. It is not safe, however, to give much weight to
    this coincidence, for higher densities and probably higher resistances
    to distortion come into play in the deeper horizons. If these
    resistances are proportional to the higher densities of the interior,
    the deductions would remain the same. If the effective rigidity of the
    earth as a whole is that of steel, as deduced by Kelvin and Darwin
    from tidal and other observations, or twice that of steel, as inferred
    by Milne from the transmission of seismic vibrations, the supporting
    power of the body of the earth dependent on its sphericity would be
    appreciably higher.</p>

  <p>It would seem clear from the foregoing considerations that something
    more than the mere crust of the earth has been involved in the great
    deformations. Indeed it is not clear that the fullest resources of
    stress-accumulation which the spheroidal form of the earth affords are
    sufficient to meet the demands of the problem, unless the rigidity of
    the earth be taken at a much higher value than that of surface-rock,
    and this is perhaps an additional argument for the high rigidities
    inferred from tides and seismic waves.</p>

  <p>In view of the doubtful competency of even the thickest segments to
    accumulate the requisite stresses, there is need to consider modes
    of differential stress-accumulation other than those dependent on
    sphericity.</p>

  <p><b>Stress-accumulation independent of sphericity.—</b>The principle of
    the dome is brought into play whenever an interior shell shrinks away,
    or tends to shrink away, from an outer one which does not shrink. In
    this case, there is a free outer surface and a more or less unsupported
    under surface toward which motion is possible. The dome may, therefore,
    yield by crushing or by contortion. The computations given above are
    for cases of this kind. But where the thickness becomes great and
    the dome involves a large part or even all of a sector of the earth,
    freedom of motion beneath is small, and to readjust the matter to a new
    form, strains must be developed widely throughout the sector, and must
    involve regions where the pressure is extremely great on all sides,
    and crushing in the usual sense impossible. Assuming the correctness
    of the modern doctrine that such pressure increases rigidity, instead
    of the older doctrine that it gives plasticity, it becomes reasonable
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span> assume that stress-differences would be distributed throughout the
    mass, and bring into play a large portion of its stress-accumulating
    competency. When the mass yielded, it would not be by crushing, but by
    “flowage,” which would be more or less general throughout the mass.
    It might, however, be partially concentrated, as, for example, on the
    borders of sectors of different specific gravity.</p>

  <p>Stress-differences may arise from physical changes within the rock
    itself. Whenever there is a re-aggregation of matter, or a change
    of any kind which involves change of volume, a change of stress
    is liable to be involved. It may be of the nature of relief or of
    intensification. In an earth built up by the haphazard infall of
    matter, a very heterogeneous mass must result, and the subsequent
    changes may be supposed to be intimately distributed through the
    mass, being slight at any point, but present at innumerable points.
    An immeasurable number of small stress-differences may, therefore, be
    developed throughout the mass. Until these overmatch the effective
    strength of the mass, they may continue to accumulate. These are not
    necessarily connected with stresses that arise from sphericity, and may
    work more or less independently of them. It is not improbable that the
    great stress-accumulating power of the globe finds an essential part of
    its explanation in supplemental considerations of this kind, and not
    wholly in its spheroidal form.</p>

  <p><b>The actual configuration of the surface.—</b>The foregoing
    computations relative to the power of shells of the earth to sustain
    pressures are based on ideal forms and structures that are not realized
    in fact. How far the earth fails to conform to these conditions must
    now be considered. When compared with the earth as a whole, the
    inequalities of its surface are trivial. If the great dynamic forces
    acted through the whole or the larger part of the body of the earth,
    the configuration of the surface can be supposed to have done little
    more than influence the location of the surface deformations and their
    special phases. But if the forces were limited to a crust of moderate
    thickness, the configuration of the surface is a matter of radical
    importance.</p>

  <p><b>Concave tracts.—</b>There is need, therefore, to inquire if any
    considerable breadth of the crust is outwardly plane or concave, for
    the principle of the dome is obviously not applicable to a plane or
    concave surface. To be a source of fatal weakness, the concavity must
    be broad enough to cause the planes of equal cooling, the isogeotherms,
    to be concave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span> to considerable depths. For example, if the hypothetical
    level of no stress is eight miles below the surface, as computed on
    certain assumptions, the concave portion must be so broad that the
    isogeotherms will also be concave outward at something near that
    depth; in other words, the main part of the zone of thrust must be
    concave. A narrow concavity at the surface, such as an ordinary valley
    in a portion of the crust that has the average convexity, would not
    seriously depress the isogeotherms, or affect the zone of thrust, but
    a valley several times eight miles (level of no stress) in breadth
    would. For inspecting the surface of the earth in this regard, it is
    convenient to know what amounts of fall below the level surface give
    a true plane for given distances. These are shown in the following

  <p>Applying these criteria to the surface of the lithosphere, <i>it
    is found that concave tracts from 100 to 300 miles in breadth are
    not uncommon</i>. The more notable of these are shown in black on
    the accompanying map, <a href="#fig454"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 454</a>, and two typical ones are shown in
    cross-section in <abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig455">455</a> and <a href="#fig456">456</a>. It is to be observed that concave
    tracts border the continents very generally. They are connected with
    the descent from the continental shelf to the abysmal basins, and are
    unsymmetrical. Notable concavities are found in some of the great
    valleys on the continental platforms. The basins of Lake Superior,
    Michigan, Huron, and Ontario are in part concave; so are Puget Sound,
    the Adriatic, and the Dead Sea; so also are the valleys of California,
    of the Po, and of the Ganges, when the adjacent mountains are included.
    Some of the “deeps” of the bottom of the ocean are notably concave.
    <a href="#fig455"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 455</a>, a cross-section of the Challenger Deep, <i>drawn to true
    scale and convexity</i>, shows the nature of the phenomenon. The
    breadth is here 300 miles, and the depression below a true plane
    is 11,400 feet. The lower line of the figure shows the approximate
    position and form of the normal isogeotherm about ten miles below the
    surface. Assuming equal conductivity in all parts, it is clear that
    the isogeotherms must be concave upwards for a considerable distance
    below ten miles. Unless the shell of thrust is much more than ten
    miles thick, these concave portions should yield as fast as cooling
    below them permits, and <i>no stresses arising from convexity could be
    accumulated</i>.</p>

  <p>These concavities of surface are so extensive and so widely distributed
    over the globe that <i>no part of the outer shell can be supposed to be
    capable of accumulating notable stresses</i> unless rigidly attached
    to the earth-body below. In other words, so far as sphericity is
    concerned, the crust must ease all its stresses nearly as fast as they
    accumulate, if, as usually assumed, it rests on a contracting or mobile
    substratum.</p>

  <p>Surface cooling under these conditions should give only feeble thrusts,
    developed and eased nearly constantly. Such movements should be
    admirably adapted to give those gentle, nearly constant subsidences
    that furnish the nice adjustments of water-depth required for the
    accumulation of thick strata in shallow water, and those slow upward
    warpings that renew the feeding-grounds of erosion, the necessary
    complement of the deposition. These gentle, nearly constant movements
    mark every stage of geological history, and constitute one of its
    greatest though least obtrusive features. <i>But if superficial
    stresses arising in this way are eased in producing these effects, they
    cannot accumulate to cause the great periodic movements.</i></p>

  <p>Even where the crust is not concave, it is so warped and so traversed
    by folds and fault-planes that its resistance to thrust is relatively
    low, and it should, therefore, warp easily and at many points, if the
    thrust be confined to a superficial crust.</p>

  <p><b>General conclusion.—</b>When to the weakness of the crust, as
    computed under ideal conditions, there is added the weakness inherent
    in these concave and warped tracts, the conclusion seems imperative
    that while the crust is the pliant subject of minor and nearly constant
    warpings, such as are everywhere implied in the stratigraphic series,
    it is wholly incompetent to be the medium of those great deformations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span>
    which occur at long intervals and mark off the great eras of geologic
    history. These great deformations apparently involve the whole, or a
    large part, of the body of the earth, and seem to require a very high
    state of effective rigidity.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE EXTRUSIVE PROCESSES.</div>

  <p><b>Outward movements.—</b>In the preceding chapters movements toward
    the center have been considered. The complementary processes of outward
    movement now invite attention. Without doubt these are mainly but a
    resultant of the centripetal actions. For each pound of material moved
    outwards an equivalent is quite surely moved inwards. Notwithstanding
    this, the outward movements have a peculiar nature of their own, and
    serve a function of radical importance in the economy of the globe.
    Some minor phases have been incidentally considered, such as the upward
    flow of springs and deep-seated waters, but here the descending and
    ascending factors are alike, and are closely and obviously connected.</p>

  <h3>VULCANISM.</h3>

  <p>The great example of ascensive action is the movement of fluid rock
    from the interior outwards. The term vulcanism will be used to embrace
    not only volcanic phenomena in the narrower sense, but all outward
    forcing of molten material, whether strictly extrusive or merely
    ascensive.</p>

  <p>The philosophy of this ascensive action, taken as a whole, is simple.
    In the effort at concentration under the powerful action of the
    earth’s gravity, the material of high specific gravity is urged more
    strongly toward the center, volume for volume, than that of less
    specific gravity, and as gravity is perpetually active, it follows that
    whenever any movement, molecular or molar, takes place which permits a
    readjustment of the positions of the two kinds of matter, the heavier
    sinks toward the center and the lighter rises, or at least tends to
    do so. So also where there are stress-differences, the mobile matter
    tends to flow from the regions of greater stress toward those of lesser
    stress. In so far as any portion of the interior becomes liquid, it
    is free to move up or down according to the balance of stress brought
    to bear upon it, and adapts itself to any line of least resistance
    available to it. As a natural result, therefore, the portion of the
    interior which becomes fluid most largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span> participates in the outward
    movement. In so far as molecular action permits a readjustment of
    material, there is a tendency, even in the solid state, for the lighter
    material to move upwards and the heavier downwards, and for the more
    stressed portions to move toward points of less stress; but this takes
    place with extreme slowness. In so far as the materials of the interior
    diffuse themselves through each other, the same laws hold good, but
    they are modified by the special principles that control diffusion.
    The outward diffusion of interior gases may be a factor of appreciable
    importance, but this cannot be affirmed at present.</p>

  <p><b>Phases of vulcanism.—</b>The forcing of fluid rock outward
    assumes two general phases, which, however, merge into each other;
    and these main phases take on various sub-phases. The first phase
    embraces those outward movements of fluid rock which do not reach the
    surface. The lavas, after ascending to the vicinity of the surface,
    intrude themselves into the outer formations of the earth and congeal
    underground (plutonic). The second phase embraces those outward
    movements in which the fluid rock reaches the surface and gives rise
    to eruptive phenomena (volcanic). The first is <i>intrusive</i>, the
    second <i>extrusive</i>; the first constitutes <i>irruptions</i>, the
    second <i>eruptions</i>.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The fundamental nature of the two is the
    same, but the extrusions usually take on special phases because of the
    relief of pressure at the surface of the earth, and because of the
    action of surface-waters in contact with the heated lavas. Just where
    the lavas come from, and how they find their way through the deep-lying
    compact zone below the zone of fracture, may better be considered
    later. When they reach the zone of fracture, they usually either
    take advantage of fissures already formed, or force passageways for
    themselves by fracture. There is little evidence that they bore their
    way through the rocks by melting, though they appear to round out their
    channels in some way into pipes, ducts, and other tubular forms when
    they flow through them for long periods of time.</p>

  <h4>1. <i>Intrusions.</i></h4>

  <p>Fluid rock forced into fissures and solidified there forms
    <i>dikes</i>; forced into chimney-like passages, it forms <i>pipes</i>
    or <i>plugs</i>; insinuated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
    between beds, it forms <i>sills</i>; bunched under strata so as to arch
    them upwards, it forms <i>laccoliths</i>; massed in great aggregations
    underground, it constitutes <i>batholiths</i>, as already described
    (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_394">394</a> and <a href="#Page_500">500</a>). Lavas sometimes crowd aside the adjacent rocks so
    far as to cause them to take a concentric form about the intruded mass.
    This is not uncommon in the oldest formations, and is probably not
    infrequent in the deeper horizons where the pressures are very great.
    Some part of this may, however, be due to later deformations. Nearer
    the surface, usually, the beds are merely lifted as in forming the
    sills, or are bowed upwards, as in the laccoliths, or faulted as in
    <i>bysmaliths</i> (<a href="#Page_500"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 500</a>).</p>

  <p><b>The heating action</b> on the adjacent rock varies greatly with
    the mass and temperature of the intruded lava. Thin dikes and sills
    often produce little effect, while greater and hotter masses notably
    metamorphose the adjacent rock. In some cases marked effects are due
    to a thin stream of lava flowing through a fissure for a long period,
    and so maintaining a high temperature. In the least effective cases,
    the adjacent rock usually shows some signs of baking. In the marked
    cases, there is more or less new crystallization. The surrounding rock
    commonly shows some evidence of material derived from the lavas; less
    often the lava shows some evidence of having received material from
    the adjacent rock. But since the lavas do not usually bore their way
    through the strata in the zone of fracture, nor melt the adjacent rock,
    the constitution of the lavas is not appreciably changed by the kinds
    of rock which they penetrate. On the other hand, the intrusions often
    show the effects of rather rapid cooling by contact with the adjacent
    rock, (<i>a</i>) by a less coarse crystallization near the rock-walls,
    and sometimes (<i>b</i>) in a segregation of the material.</p>

  <h4>2. <i>Extrusions.</i></h4>

  <p>When molten rock is forced to the surface it gives rise to the most
    intense and impressive of all geological phenomena. The energies
    acquired in the interior under great compression here find sudden
    relief. Occluded gases often expand with extreme violence, hurling
    portions of the lavas to great heights and shattering them into
    fragments constituting “smoke,” ash, cinders, bombs, and other
    pyroclastic material. Much of the explosive violence of volcanoes
    has been attributed to the contact of surface-waters with the hot
    rising lava, but the function of this kind of action has probably been
    exaggerated.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span></p>

  <p>There are two phases of extrusion often quite strongly contrasted.
    The one is explosive ejection, often attended with great violence;
    the other, a quiet out-welling of the lava, with little more than
    ebullition. More or less closely related to these differences are two
    classes of conduits, (<i>a</i>) the one, great fissures, out of which
    the lava pours in great volume and spreads forth over wide tracts,
    often in broad thin sheets; (<i>b</i>) the other, restricted openings,
    often pipes, ducts, or limited fissures, from which the extrusion is
    usually much less abundant, and hence it more largely congeals near
    the orifice, forming cones. Flows from the former constitute massive
    eruptions; those from the latter, the more familiar volcanic eruptions.
    There is no radical difference between them, and the two classes blend.
    The extent of the spreading of lava into thin sheets is due more to the
    mass and the fluidity than to the form of the outlet. The stupendous
    outflows of certain geologic periods appear to have issued mainly from
    extended fissures, doubtless because these better accommodated the
    outbursting floods.</p>

  <p><b><i>a.</i> Fissure eruptions.—</b>The chief known fissure eruptions
    of recent times are the vast basaltic floods of Iceland. Most of the
    eruptions of historic times are of the volcanic type; but at certain
    times in the past there were prodigious outpourings, flow following
    flow until layers thousands of feet thick covering thousands of square
    miles were built up. One of these occurred in Tertiary times in Idaho,
    Oregon, and Washington, where some 200,000 square miles were covered
    with sheets of lava, aggregating in places 2000 feet or more in
    thickness. Earlier than this, in Cretaceous times, there were enormous
    flows on the Deccan plateau of India, covering a like area to a depth
    of 4000 to 6000 feet. Still earlier than this, in Keweenawan times, an
    even more prolonged succession of lava-flows covered nearly all the
    area of the Lake Superior basin, and extended beyond it, and built up
    a series of almost incredible thickness, the estimates reaching 15,000
    to 25,000 feet. In these cases there is little evidence of explosive
    or other violent action. There are few beds of ash, cinders, and
    similar pyroclastic material. The inference is, therefore, that the
    lavas welled out rather quietly and spread themselves rather fluently
    over the surrounding country. For the most part these wide-spreading
    flows are composed of basic material, which is more easily fusible and
    more highly fluent at a given temperature than the acidic lavas. The
    latter are more disposed to form thick embossments near the point of
    extrusion.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span></p>

  <p>Massive outflows of this class constitute by far the greatest phenomena
    of the extrusive type, though they are not now the dominant type.
    It has been sometimes thought that the more local volcanic type of
    extrusion followed the more massive fissure type as a phase of decline;
    but this has not been substantiated.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b><i>b.</i> Volcanic eruptions.—</b>In the types of eruption
    prevailing at the present time, the lavas are forced out through ducts
    or perhaps short fissures or sections of fissures, and build up cones
    about the vents, the eruptive action maintaining craters in the centers
    of the cones. The essential feature of a volcano is the issuance of hot
    rock and gas from a local vent. A mountain is the usual result, but the
    mountain is secondary and not usually present in the first stages; the
    localized eruption is the primary and necessary factor. The amount of
    rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span> matter ejected is not necessarily great. Compared to the massive
    extrusions of fissure eruptions, it is usually rather trivial; but the
    volcano makes up in demonstrativeness what it lacks in massiveness of
    product.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span></p>

  <p><i>c.</i> <b>Intermediate phenomena.—</b>On the border-line between
    the intrusive and the extrusive phenomena there are special cases
    of interest. There appear to be certain instances in which the
    intrusion comes so near the surface as to develop explosive phenomena
    without the extrusion of lava. From the nature of the case this is an
    interpretation rather than a demonstration. It is certain, however,
    that occasional violent explosions take place where no lava comes in
    sight. This sometimes occurs in old volcanic formations, and sometimes
    in regions of undisturbed horizontal strata. In the former case the
    phenomena may be due to the intrusion of a fresh tongue of lava below,
    or it may be due to the penetration of surface-waters to hot rocks
    that have remained uncooled from previous volcanic action, and the
    development, by such contact, of a volume of confined steam sufficient
    to produce the explosion. A case of this doubtful kind occurred at
    Bandai-San in Japan in 1888, where there was a sudden and violent
    explosion which blew away a considerable part of the side of a volcanic
    mountain which had not been in eruption for at least a thousand years.
    The mass and violence of the exploded material was such as to fill the
    air with ashes and débris in a fashion altogether similar to a typical
    volcanic eruption. A large tract of adjacent country was devastated,
    and many lives lost. The whole action, however, was concentrated in
    the initial explosion, and within a few hours the cloud of ashes
    had disappeared and the phenomenon was ended. An examination of the
    disrupted area revealed no signs of liquid lava.</p>

  <p>An example of the latter class is Coon Butte in Arizona.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> This
    consists of a rim of fragmental material encircling a crater-like pit
    from which the fragments were obviously forced by violent explosion.
    The pit is in ordinary sedimentary strata, and the material of the rim
    is composed of the disrupted fragments of the sedimentary rock ejected
    from the pit. There are no signs of igneous material, but there was
    igneous action in the vicinity. Fragments of a meteorite were found
    on the rim and in the vicinity, but this association appears to be
    accidental. Computation shows that the volume of the material of the
    rim closely matches the size of the pit. The source of the explosion
    is not demonstrable, and it may be an error to connect it with an
    intrusion of lava below; but since intrusions rise to various degrees
    of nearness to the surface, and in innumerable cases reach the surface,
    there is every reason to entertain the conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span> of a class of
    intrusions which develop explosive phenomena by close approach to the
    surface, without actually reaching it.</p>

    taken at Lick Observatory.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Lunar craters.—</b>There are grounds for thinking that the
    remarkable craters of the moon, assuming that they are truly
    volcanic,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> may belong to this class, for they are very similar to
    the Coon Butte pit. The capacities of the lunar craters, so far as they
    can be estimated, seem to equal, if they do not in many cases exceed,
    the volume of matter in their rims. They do not appear usually to be
    great cones of accumulated material with relatively small craters,
    like the typical products of terrestrial volcanoes. Besides, there
    are no clear evidences of lava-streams. The radiating tracts once
    interpreted as such have been shown by increased telescopic power
    and the resources of photography to be at least something other than
    lava-streams. They are vaguely defined tracts which run over heights
    and depths indifferently, and are plausibly interpreted as lines of
    débris projected to extraordinary distances because of the absence of a
    lunar atmosphere, and because of the low force of the moon’s gravity.
    Since the moon now has no appreciable atmosphere or surface-waters, and
    since it is doubtful whether it ever possessed either on account of its
    probable inability to hold atmospheric gases or the vapor of water in
    the form of an envelope about it, owing to its low gravity, there is
    reason to suppose that the external matter of the moon derived from the
    explosions of the multitude of lunar volcanoes would remain in a loose,
    incoherent condition, from the absence of dissolving and cementing
    agencies. It is reasonable to suppose that lava-tongues arising from
    the deeper interior would have a higher specific gravity, even in their
    heated condition, than this porous covering of the moon, and that
    therefore they would almost universally become intrusions rather than
    extrusions, or at most they would not rise beyond the bottom of the
    craters they had produced by explosion. This seems to furnish at least
    a plausible explanation of the prevailing differences between the large
    lunar craters encircled by mere rims and the much smaller terrestrial
    craters seated in relatively large cones.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">599</span></p>

  <h3>VOLCANOES.</h3>

  <p><b>Number of volcanoes.—</b>It is impracticable to state exactly the
    number of volcanoes that are active at the present time, because most
    volcanoes are periodic, and become active at more or less distant
    periods, and it is impossible to say whether a given volcano that may
    be now quiescent has really become extinct or is only enjoying its
    customary period of rest. It is quite safe to include at least 300 in
    the active list, and the number may reach 350 or more. The numbers that
    have been active so recently that their cones have not been entirely
    worn away is several times as great.</p>

  <h4><i>Distribution of Volcanoes.</i></h4>

  <p>1. <b>In time.—</b>In the earliest known ages igneous action appears to
    have been very general, if not practically universal. No area of the
    earliest (Archean) rocks is now known which is not formed chiefly of
    rocks that appear to have been either intruded or extruded. Rocks which
    can reasonably be assigned to the hypothetical molten globe, if there
    be such, are not here included. It is probable that the surface of the
    early earth was as thickly occupied with points of extrusion as the
    surface of the moon appears to be. In the ages between the Archean and
    the present, the distribution of volcanic action over the surface seems
    to have been in a general way much what it is to-day; that is, certain
    areas were volcanically active at times, while other and larger areas
    were measurably free from any outward expressions of igneous action.
    This is not equally true of all ages, as will be seen in the historical
    studies that follow. There were periods when volcanic activity seems
    to have been widespread and energetic, and others when it was limited
    both in amount and distribution. The known facts do not indicate a
    steady decline in volcanic activity, but rather a periodicity; at
    least this is so for the portion of the globe that is now well enough
    known geologically to warrant conclusions. One of the greatest of the
    volcanic periods falls within the Cenozoic era, just preceding the
    present geological period, and the volcanic activity of the present is
    perhaps but a declining phase of that time.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Relative to land and sea.—</b>At present the active volcanoes
    are chiefly distributed about the borders of the continents, and, less
    notably, within the great oceanic basins. On this account the sea has
    often been supposed to have some connection with volcanic action, and
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span> presence of chlorine in the volcanic emanations has been cited
    in support of this position. When critically examined, however, the
    argument from distribution is not very strong; for the volcanoes are
    not distributed equally or proportionately about the several oceans,
    as if dependent on them. Volcanoes are especially numerous around and
    within the Pacific, the greatest of the oceans, and this might seem a
    favorable instance, but they are also numerous around and within the
    Mediterranean, a relatively small body of water. Volcanoes are not
    especially abundant in or about the margins of the Atlantic.</p>

    Relief Globe. (Photo. by R. T. Chamberlin.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>If volcanoes were dependent upon proximity to the sea, the relation
    should be close in the past as well as in the present, but this does
    not seem to be true. There has recently been much volcanic activity
    in the plateau region of western America at long distances from the
    Pacific basin. Even on the plains east of the Rocky Mountains notable
    volcanic action took place. There were also volcanoes in the interior
    of Asia and of Africa.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span></p>

  <p>3. <b>Relative to crustal deformations.—</b>The distribution of present
    and recent volcanoes is much more suggestively associated with those
    portions of the crust <i>that have undergone notable changes</i>
    in position in comparatively recent times. The great “world-ridge”
    stretching from Cape Horn to Alaska and thence onwards along the east
    coast of Asia is a striking instance, for it is dotted throughout with
    active and recently extinct volcanoes. The tortuous zone of mountainous
    wrinkles that borders the Mediterranean and stretches thence eastward
    to the Polynesian Islands is another notable volcanic tract. These two
    belts include the greater number of existing and recent volcanoes on
    the land, while the great basins associated with them embrace the chief
    oceanic volcanoes.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>There is perhaps some significance in the fact that the most active
    regions of vulcanism to-day lie <i>at the angular junctions of
    the great earth-segments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span></i>. The Antillean and Central American
    volcanic region, that has recently been so demonstrative, lies where
    the southern angle of the North American continental block joins the
    northern angle of the South American continental block, and where the
    western angle of the North Atlantic abysmal segment closely approaches
    one of the eastern angles of the great Pacific abysmal segment. The
    complex and very active Java-Philippine volcanic region lies where
    the southeastern angle of the great Asian segment projects toward the
    Australian block, and where the western angle of the Pacific block
    approaches the northeastern angle of the Indian oceanic segment. The
    active Alaskan volcanic area lies at the angles of the North American,
    Asian, Pacific, and Arctic segments. The Mediterranean volcanic area
    falls less notably under this generalization, but it lies where the
    continental blocks of Europe and Africa come into peculiar relations
    to each other on either side of the remarkable Mediterranean trough.
    The eastern angle of the North Atlantic segment is near by, but not in
    very close relations. The Icelandic region, small but vigorous, lies
    near the junction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span> of the North American, European, North Atlantic, and
    Arctic segments, and the New Zealand volcanic region is somewhat less
    closely related to the approach of the Australian, Antarctic, Pacific,
    and Southern oceanic segments. Nearly all of these angular conjunctions
    involve two depressed segments joining two relatively elevated
    segments. This relationship suggests a causal connection between the
    intensified movements at these angular conjunctions and the intensified
    volcanic action of these regions. There are enough volcanoes, however,
    that do not fall into these groups, or apparently into any other
    grouping, to suggest that the development of volcanoes is not wholly
    dependent on any surface relationship, but that it is connected with
    deep-seated causes that are indeed modified, but not wholly controlled,
    by surface conditions, or even by the movements of the master segments
    of the earth’s crust.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>4. <b>In latitude.—</b>The distribution of volcanoes appears to have
    no specific relation to latitude. Mounts Erebus and Terror, amid
    the ice-mantle of Antarctica, and Mount Hecla in Iceland, as well
    as the numerous volcanoes of the Aleutian chain, give no ground for
    supposing that volcanoes shun the frigid zones. On the other hand,
    the numerous volcanoes of the equatorial zone do not imply that they
    avoid the torrid belt. Their distribution appears to be independent
    of latitude. This is not cited because of any supposed effects of
    external temperature, for that must be trivial, but because it bears
    on the question whether strains are now arising from the supposed
    <i>slackening of the earth’s rotation</i>, which have any connection
    with volcanic action. If the oblateness of the earth is decreasing,
    the equatorial belt must be sinking and growing shorter, and hence
    must be under lateral pressure, while the polar caps must be rising,
    and increasing their curvatures, and should be under tension. These
    conditions, if real, might be supposed to have something to do with
    the extrusion of lava. Nothing in the present or the past distribution
    of igneous action seems to afford much support to this hypothetical
    inference.</p>

  <p>5. <b>In curved lines.—</b>In the Antilles, the Aleutian Islands, the
    Kurile Islands, and in other instances, there is a notable linear
    arrangement of volcanoes with appreciable curvature. It has been noted
    that the convexity of the curves is turned toward the adjacent ocean.
    In some cases, however, there is a notable linear arrangement without
    appreciable curvature, as in the Hawaiian range, in the recently
    extinct line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">604</span> of cones of the Cascade Range, and in others. Less often,
    volcanoes are bunched irregularly, as in some of the groups of volcanic
    islands of the Pacific (<a href="#fig460"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 460</a>).</p>

  <h4><i>Relations of Volcanoes.</i></h4>

  <p>1. <b>Relations to rising and sinking surfaces.—</b>So far as
    observations cover this point, the area immediately adjacent to
    active volcanoes is rising (Dutton). This is shown by raised beaches,
    terraces, coral deposits, etc. Whether this is wholly due to the
    expansional effect of the heating of the subterrane by the rising lava,
    or whether it has a wider significance, is not known. If a broader
    view is taken, it does not appear that there are sufficient data to
    connect volcanic action exclusively with either the rising or the
    sinking of the general surface. It is certain that the great mountain
    ranges and plateaus in which so much of the more recent volcanic action
    has taken place have been recently elevated relatively, but they have
    also undergone more or less of oscillation, involving some relative
    depression. The question whether the Pacific basin as a whole has been
    relatively elevated or depressed in modern times is a mooted one.
    Darwin<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and Dana,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> as the result of their early studies on its
    coral deposits and on other phenomena, concluded that the Pacific was a
    sinking area, but this view has been recently challenged by Murray<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
    and Agassiz<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> with at least some measure of success. From the
    fiords on the borders of the Pacific and other physical phenomena, the
    inference has been drawn that relative sinking of the land has recently
    taken place. Raised beaches on the coasts are interpreted as indicating
    a relative rise of the land or a sinking of some ocean basin, for the
    withdrawal of the waters can only be the result of increasing the
    capacity of the oceanic basin as a whole. The most probable view is
    that the general areas of present and recent volcanic action are partly
    rising areas and partly sinking areas, and that movement of either
    kind may be connected with the extrusion of the lavas. The rising and
    sinking are but complementary phases of a deformation of the earth’s
    body, and involve a readjustment of stresses within the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">605</span>body of the
    earth. These stresses are possibly an essential factor in eruptions.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Relations to one another.—</b>A most significant feature of
    volcanic action is the degree of concurrence or of independence of
    action in adjacent volcanoes. In some instances they act as though in
    sympathy, as in the recent outburst in Martinique and Saint Vincent,
    and the concurrent symptoms of activity in other places. On the other
    hand, the independence of neighboring vents is sometimes extraordinary.
    The group of volcanoes near the center of the Mediterranean, of which
    Vesuvius and Etna are the most conspicuous examples, usually act with
    measurable independence of one another, an eruption in the one not
    being habitually coincident with an eruption in the others. But the
    most conspicuous instance of independence is found in the great craters
    of Mauna Loa and Kilauea in Hawaii. They are only about twenty miles
    apart, the one on the top and the other on the side of the same great
    mountain mass. The crater of Mauna Loa is about 10,000 feet higher
    than the crater of Kilauea, and yet, while the latter has been in
    constant activity as far back as its history is known, the former is
    periodic. The case is the more remarkable because of the greatness of
    the ejections. The outflow of Mauna Loa in 1885 formed a stream from
    three to ten miles in width, and forty-five miles in length, with a
    probable average thickness of 100 feet, and some of its other outflows
    were of nearly equal greatness; indeed its outflows are among the
    most massive that have issued from volcanoes in recent times. Besides
    this massiveness there have been extraordinary movements of the lava
    within the crater, if the testimony of witnesses may be trusted. But
    throughout these great movements in the higher crater, the lava-column
    of Kilauea, 10,000 feet lower, continued its quiet action without
    sensible effects from its boisterous neighbor. The bearing of such
    extraordinary independence upon the sources of volcanic action is very
    cogent, for the lavas are of the same type, both being basalts, that of
    Mauna Loa being notably basic and probably as high in specific gravity
    as that in Kilauea. No difference in specific gravity that could at
    all account for a difference in height of 10,000 feet can be presumed,
    unless their ducts remain separate to extraordinary depths. Nor does
    it appear possible that a superior amount of gas within the column of
    Mauna Loa could account for such an extraordinary difference in height,
    for the hydrostatic pressure of such a column is not far from 10,000
    pounds to the square inch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">606</span> Even if the difference in the heights of
    the columns could be explained by differences in specific gravity,
    the agitation of the one should be communicated to the other, and an
    outflow of the one, particularly an outflow by a breakage through
    its walls sufficient to lower its surface hundreds of feet, as has
    repeatedly occurred in Kilauea, should change the surface of the other
    proportionately, if they were in hydrostatic equilibrium. It seems
    a necessary inference, therefore, that the two lava-columns have no
    connection with each other or with a common reservoir. The tops of some
    lava-columns stand about 20,000 feet above the sea, while others emerge
    on the sea-bottom far below sea-level. The total vertical range is,
    therefore, probably between 30,000 and 40,000 feet, a difference which
    tells its own story as to their relative independence.</p>

  <p>3. <b>Unimportant coincidences.—</b>Eruptions seem to be somewhat more
    liable to occur at times of high atmospheric pressure than at low,
    doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">607</span> because the increased atmospheric weight on a large area of
    the adjacent crust aids in forcing out the lava or the volcanic gases.
    This can only be effective when other forces have almost accomplished
    the result, and would doubtless have completed it a little later had
    not the atmospheric wave supplied the little remaining pressure needed.
    Eruption seems also to be more common when the tidal strains favor it,
    for like reasons. In the same class are probably to be put the effects
    of heavy rains, whether they act by gravity or by giving rise to steam.
    Such agencies are to be regarded as mere incidents of no moment in
    the real causation of vulcanism, but of some value in determining the
    precise moment of action. This is not to be understood as inconsistent
    with the view that the periodic stresses of the body-tides of the
    earth are important factors in vulcanism, as elsewhere explained, but
    merely that the special time of surface-eruption is only incidentally
    connected with the water-tides.</p>

  <p><b>Periodicity.—</b>Most volcanoes are periodic in their stages of
    action. Long dormant periods intervene between eruptive periods.
    Volcanoes supposed to be extinct occasionally awaken with terrific
    violence. Sometimes also they awaken quietly. This larger periodicity
    yet awaits an explanation, but it very likely means a temporary
    exhaustion of the supply of gas or of lava, or of both, to which the
    active stage is due.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">608</span></p>

  <h4><i>Formation of Cones.</i></h4>

  <p><b>Lava-cones.—</b>The lava usually flows away from the vent in short
    streams which solidify before running far. As the lava-streams flow in
    different directions at different times, the total effect is a low cone
    formed of radiating tongues surrounding the point of exit. Occasionally
    the streams run a dozen or a score of miles, but such cases, except in
    the gigantic volcanoes of Hawaii and a few others, are rare. Often the
    streams congeal before they reach much beyond the base of the cone, and
    quite often while they are yet on its slope. So far, therefore, as the
    volcanic cone is formed of lava, it has a radiate structure made up of
    a succession of congealed lava-streams. In these cases the slopes are
    low, because the fluidity of the lava prevents the development of high
    gradients. It is, however, rather the exception than the rule, that
    the cone is made up mainly of lava-streams, though the great Hawaiian
    volcanoes are of this class.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Cinder-cones.—</b>The larger portion of the lava blown into the air
    by the expanding gas-bubbles falls back in the immediate vicinity of
    the vent and builds up a cinder-cone. From the nature of the case, this
    often takes on a beautiful symmetry and assumes a steep slope (<a href="#fig465"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr>
    465</a>). The ragged cinders lend themselves readily to the formation of
    an acute cone, quite different from the flatter cone formed by lavas.
    Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">610</span> the cinders are still plastic when they fall, and weld
    themselves together and hold their places even on very steep slopes,
    but usually they have already hardened before they reach the surface.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><b>Subordinate cones.—</b>Small or temporary vents formed as offshoots
    from the main vents often give rise to secondary or “parasitic” cones.
    These are sometimes numerous, as in the case of Etna, and they may be
    so important that the mountain becomes a compound cone. A still more
    subordinate variety consists of “spatter-cones” formed by small mildly
    explosive vents that spatter forth little dabs of lava which form
    chimneys, or cones, and sometimes completely curved domes over vents
    (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig466">466</a> and <a href="#fig467">467</a>). Spatter-cones often arise from the lava-flows
    themselves.</p>

  <p><b>Composite cones.—</b>From most existing volcanoes there issue both
    lava-flows and fragmental ejecta, and the resulting cones are composite
    in material. The lava more frequently breaks through the side of the
    cone than overflows its summit, and this gives rise to irregularities
    of form and structure. The cones are also subject to partial
    destruction both by the outbursts of lava and by the explosions, and
    perhaps also by migration of the vents. As a result, many volcanic
    regions show old, partially destroyed craters, together with new and
    more perfect ones, and the history of volcanic action in a region may
    often be read in the succession of cone formations.</p>

  <p>The form of the cone, when composed chiefly of lava, is also affected
    by the mass of the outflow and by its fluidity. The larger the outflow
    at a given time, other things being equal, the wider it distributes
    itself and the flatter is the cone. As a rule, the basic lavas are more
    fluid than the acidic, and the cones of basic lavas are flatter than
    the cones of acidic lavas.</p>

  <p><b>Extra-cone distribution.—</b>In violent eruptions, the steam,
    accompanied with much ash, is shot up to great heights, often rolling
    outwards in cumulus or cauliflower-like forms (<a href="#fig458"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 458</a>). In the more
    violent explosions these columns are projected several miles. In the
    phenomenal case of Krakatoa the projection was estimated at seventeen
    miles. The steam, by reason of its great expansion and its contact
    with the colder regions of the upper air, is quickly condensed, and
    prodigious floods of rain frequently accompany the eruption. This
    rain, carrying down a portion of the ash and gathering up much that
    had previously fallen, gives rise to <i>mud-flows</i>, which in some
    cases constitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">611</span> a large part of the final deposit. These mud-flows
    chiefly lodge on the lower slopes of the volcano or adjacent to its
    base, and give rise to rather flat cones, sometimes designated as
    <i>tufa-cones</i> to distinguish them from cinder-cones formed by the
    direct fall of fragmental material. Mud-flows appear also to be formed
    by the ejection of mud and water that had gathered in quiescent craters
    during intervals between stages of eruption.</p>

  <p>A portion of the finer exploded material floats away in the air to
    greater or less distances, and forms widespread <i>tufa-deposits</i>.
    In. some cases beds of volcanic ash of appreciable thickness (as those
    of Nebraska)<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> are found far from any known volcanic center. The
    extremely fine ash from the great explosion of Krakatoa floated several
    times around the earth in the equatorial belt and spread northward into
    the temperate zones.</p>

  <h3>LAVAS.</h3>

  <p><b>Their nature.—</b>In the chapter on the Origin and Descent of
    Rocks, the nature of lavas and of the rocks derived from them has
    been discussed (<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>). In view of prevalent misconceptions,
    it may be repeated, for the sake of emphasis, that lavas are mutual
    <i>solutions</i> of mineral matter in mineral matter, rather than
    simply melted rock. Into this mutual solution there enter not only
    rock materials, but gases. The distinction between mutual solutions
    and simple molten rock cannot be rigorously made, but it is at least
    essential to know that the minerals do not necessarily crystallize
    from lavas in the order of their melting temperatures, or in any
    uniform order, but rather in the order in which saturation of the
    several mineral constituents happens to be reached in the given mutual
    solution. Thus quartz, which has a very high melting-point, is often
    one of the last minerals to crystallize. The mutual solutions are
    exceedingly complex, embracing a wide range of chemical substances,
    but the chief of them, as already stated, are silicates of aluminum,
    potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and iron, with minor ingredients
    of nearly all known substances, in greater or less proportion. The
    old idea of lavas as simply melted rock is not, however, wholly to be
    abandoned. The mode of solidifying is often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">613</span> simply that of molten
    matter freezing. If lava be suddenly cooled, the congelation is
    essentially the solidification of a melted substance. The result is a
    glassy body, every part of which has essentially the same composition
    that the liquid had. Usually, however, even in this case, the gases
    escape in part. If the cooling is slower, the various substances in
    the mixture crystallize out into minerals in the order in which they
    severally reach saturation. This involves the principle that solubility
    is dependent on temperature, and that as the temperature sinks the
    degree of solubility declines, and the saturation-point for some
    constituents of the solution is reached earlier than for others. With
    sufficiently slow cooling, all the material will pass into the solid
    state by the crystallizing of the several minerals in succession. This
    does not mean that two or more minerals may not be forming at the same
    time, for crystals often interfere with each other’s growth. It does,
    however, involve the doctrine that some substances may complete their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">614</span>
    crystallization while the surrounding material is yet in the fluid
    condition. In most igneous rocks nearly perfect crystals of certain
    minerals are common, while other minerals, crystallizing later, are
    compelled to adapt themselves to the space left. This conception is
    supported by the fact that lavas, while still in the fluid condition,
    often contain well-formed crystals, and these crystals sometimes make
    up a considerable percent. of the flowing mass, just as water in
    certain conditions may be filled with crystals of ice. So also crystals
    after having been formed may be redissolved in part, doubtless because
    of changes in the nature of the magma due to undetermined conditions
    which may arise in the process of crystallization, or from the
    accession of gas, or from new material dissolved from the walls of the
    passageway.</p>

    Hilo, Hawaiian Islands.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><b>Consanguinity and succession of lavas.—</b>The lavas that are
    poured forth at different stages in the succession of eruptions of a
    given region are usually not the same, as might naturally be expected,
    but form a curious series the members of which are related to one
    another. Iddings has called this relation <i>consanguinity</i>.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
    No universal law of succession has yet been established, and perhaps
    none exists; but Richthofen<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> many years ago announced a definite
    order for the Tertiary flows of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">615</span>western America which seems to hold
    fairly well in its general aspects, though not everywhere completely
    realized, so far as surface observation goes. Richthofen’s order is:
    (1) lavas of neutral types, (2) lavas of acid types, (3) lavas of
    basic types, (4) lavas of more acid types, and (5) lavas of more basic
    types. The special varieties of rock vary, and even the general order
    is often apparently defective. The defects are sometimes assigned to
    the concealment of some of the outflows. While this may be true in some
    cases, it is not unlikely that in others there is a real failure of the
    sequence. At any rate, the sequence can only be regarded as a rough
    generalization. It is supposed to be due to magmatic differentiation
    caused by the differences of temperature to which the different parts
    are subjected underground, by differences of specific gravity and
    fluidity which result from changes of temperature, and probably by
    other causes.</p>

  <p><b>Temperatures of lavas.—</b>Accurate determinations of the
    temperatures in the center of the lava-columns, where they have been
    least reduced by contact with the rock-walls, have not yet been made,
    but it is clear from the whiteness of the lavas that their temperatures
    are often appreciably above the melting-point. This is also a necessary
    inference from the length of time they remain fluid, notwithstanding
    the great surface contact of the column in its miles of ascent, the
    conversion of contact water into steam, and the expansion and escape
    of the gases. In cases where determination has been practicable (and
    they certainly do not represent the maximum temperatures) it has been
    found that the melting-points of silver, about 960° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>, and of copper,
    about 1060° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>, are reached. In connection with overflows, it has
    been found that brass is decomposed into its component metals, the
    copper actually crystallizing. Silver has been sublimed, and made to
    redeposit itself in crystalline form. This implies much more than the
    bare melting temperatures. Even the fine edges of flints have been
    fused. It is, therefore, probably safe to assume that the original
    temperatures of the lavas as they rise to the surface sometimes reach
    considerably beyond 2000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> (1093° <abbr title="Centigrade">C.</abbr>), and may perhaps even attain
    3000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> or more. Even these temperatures must be somewhat below
    the original subterranean temperatures of the lavas, because some heat
    must necessarily be lost in rising, partly by contact with the walls
    of the colder rocks through which they pass, probably for as much as a
    score of miles at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">616</span> least, and partly from the expansion of the gases
    within them. If any considerable part of these gases is derived from
    waters which joined the lava in its upward course in the fracture zone,
    the energy consumed in raising the water to the high temperatures
    of the lavas must be subtracted from the original heat, and must be
    a further source of reduction of temperature. It is important to
    emphasize this point in view of its bearing upon the origin of the
    lavas. It has been suggested that lavas may be due to an aqueo-igneous
    fusion, a kind of fusion which may take place at comparatively moderate
    temperatures. It seems obvious, however, from the phenomena themselves,
    that temperatures as high as ordinary dry fusion, and perhaps even
    higher, are attained. It is clear also that the maintenance of the
    liquid condition in a constant state of ebullition for a long period
    of time implies a large surplus of heat above that necessary for
    liquefaction simply. This is especially true if the ebullition comes
    from surface-waters penetrating to and becoming absorbed in the
    lava-column below. This process must tend rapidly to exhaust the heat
    in the column of lava. If, on the other hand, the gases are derived
    from the deep interior, and the ebullition at the surface is due to
    their escape, they may bring up new supplies of heat to counteract the
    cooling effects of their expansion.</p>

  <p><b>Depth of source.—</b>Attempts have been made to ascertain the
    depth from which lavas rise, by means of the earthquake tremors that
    accompany eruptions. The estimates have ranged from seven or eight to
    thirty miles. The mode of estimate is that discussed under earthquakes,
    and is subject to the corrections there indicated. If these could
    be perfectly applied, the estimates might probably all fall within
    ten miles, and not improbably all within six miles of the surface.
    But in any case the method really tells very little as to the true
    point of origin of the lava. At most it probably only tells where the
    ascending lava begins to <i>rupture</i> the rock through which it
    passes, and rupture may not be possible below the zone of fracture,
    which is probably not more than six miles deep. In the zone of flowage
    below, where the pressure is too great to permit fracture, the lava
    not improbably makes its way by some boring or fluxing process, which
    might not, because of its nature, be capable of giving rise to seismic
    tremors. The behavior of the tremors perhaps forces us to locate
    the origin of lava movement <i>at least as low as the bottom of the
      fracture zone</i>, but it probably offers no sufficient ground for
    limiting the lava’s origin to this or any other specific depth.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">617</span></p>

  <h3>VOLCANIC GASES.</h3>

  <p>The most distinctive feature of volcanoes is the explosive action
    arising from the gases and vapors pent up in the lava. There is not a
    little explosive action of a secondary character arising from the mere
    outer contact of surface-waters with lavas or with the hot rocks of the
    crater walls, or with the hot ashes and rocks thrown out; but these are
    incidental, not essential, features.</p>

  <p>The precise nature of the occlusion or absorption of gases and vapors
    has not yet been determined. It is thought that lava spontaneously
    absorbs such gases when at high temperatures, and especially when the
    gases are under great pressure, and that as the pressure is relieved
    and the lava is cooled and solidified, the larger part of the gases
    escapes. In those cases in which the eruption is quiet, the escape
    of the gases is but partial while the lava is in the crater, and
    much gas remains to be given out from the molten material after it
    has been extruded and is about to congeal. The gases are then given
    off with relative slowness and quietness. If, however, the lavas are
    surcharged with gases, and if these are restrained from free escape
    by the viscosity of the lavas, the gases gather in large vesicles in
    the lava in the throat of the volcano, and on coming to the surface
    explode, hurling the enveloping lava upwards and outwards, often to
    great distances. The violence of projection reduces a portion of the
    lava to a finely divided state constituting the “ash” and “smoke” of
    the volcano. Other portions less divided are inflated by the gases
    disseminated through them, and form “pumice” and “scoria,” according
    to the degree of inflation, while masses of lava that have already
    solidified into more or less rounded masses in the crater are hurled
    forth as “bombs”; not infrequently portions of the walls of the crater
    or of the duct below are also disrupted and shot forth.</p>

  <p><b>Differences in gas action.—</b>The causes of the differences of
    gas action in different volcanoes are undetermined, but the following
    suggestions may point to a part of the truth: (1) Doubtless some lavas
    contain more gases than others, and hence are predisposed to be more
    explosive; (2) some are more viscous than others and hence hold the
    gases more tenaciously until they accumulate and acquire explosive
    force, while the more liquid lavas allow their gases to escape more
    freely and easily; (3) some are hotter than others, and hence hold
    their gases until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">618</span> after they have escaped from the crater, when they
    give them off from their expanded surfaces in the open air, where there
    is no restraint to develop explosiveness; (4) some flows are so massive
    that they cool to the chief gas-discharging point only after they are
    spread out on the surface, when quiet escape is possible; (5) probably
    a main occasion of the very violent explosions lies in the fact that
    the lavas have begun to crystallize while yet in the duct of the
    volcano. The crystals, in forming in the magma, exclude the gases from
    themselves, and this excluded portion overcharges the remaining portion
    of the lava. This process continues as the lava rises and grows cooler
    until the gases acquire great volume and explosive force. This view is
    sustained by the fact that the pumice and ash of such extraordinarily
    explosive eruptions as those of Krakatoa and Pelée contain many small
    crystals which had certainly formed before the explosive inflation took
    place. Incipient crystallization does not, however, appear to be a
    universal accompaniment of explosive action.</p>

  <p><b>Spasmodic action.—</b>The discharge of the gases is spasmodic, and
    usually consists of a succession of distinct explosions. Sometimes
    these succeed one another at rather constant and frequent intervals,
    as in Stromboli, where the explosions follow one another at intervals
    of three to ten or more minutes. In many others the outbursts are
    rhythmic, while in others the spasms are distant and irregular.</p>

  <p><b>Kinds of gases.—</b>Steam is the chief volcanic gas. Its
    constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, are also present in the free state,
    and are perhaps the result of the dissociation of the steam at the
    very high temperatures of the lavas. Carbon dioxide is probably next
    in abundance. No positive statement as to the relative amounts of the
    subordinate gases can be made because of the obvious difficulties
    of obtaining anything like a representative analysis of the gases
    concerned in the great volcanic eruptions. The materials for the
    analyses which have been made were derived chiefly from little
    secondary or “parasitic” vents, or from side-wall crevices, through
    which the volcanic gases rise. Such vents probably derive their gases
    from the very border of the main mass, where it is most subject to
    the influence of waters and gases from the adjacent walls, and it is
    uncertain how far they are truly representative of the gases in the
    interior of the lava itself. The data now at command seem to indicate
    that carbon dioxide increases greatly in relative abundance as volcanic
    action dies away. Great quantities of this gas are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">619</span> often given forth
    long after all signs of active vulcanism have disappeared. Such gases
    have been attributed to the action of the lavas on buried beds of
    limestone or other carbonates, but in many cases the geology of the
    region offers no special support to this hypothesis. It does not seem
    inherently probable that the heat of the lava would be sufficient to
    decompose limestone at a period very long after the active eruption. An
    alternative suggestion is that the stronger volcanic acids mentioned
    below are gradually conveyed into the adjacent rocks and there act on
    limestones or on partially carbonated crystalline rocks, setting free
    carbon dioxide. Whatever may be true with regard to secondary gases of
    this kind, it is quite certain that the lavas themselves contain large
    quantities of carbon dioxide, and also of carbon monoxide, doubtless
    reduced from the dioxide. Sulphur gases are very common accompaniments
    of volcanic eruptions. They take the forms of sulphuretted hydrogen
    and sulphurous acid and perhaps of sublimated sulphur, all of which
    are liable to pass by oxidation and hydration into sulphuric acid.
    Chlorine and hydrochloric gases are also common, particularly at high
    temperatures. Fluorine and other gases are occasionally present.
    Certain gases, such as hydrogen and chlorine, are especially associated
    with high temperatures and energetic action, and are probably dependent
    on them. Hydrochloric acid and the sulphurous gases are also mainly
    associated with high temperatures, while sulphuretted hydrogen is
    commoner at lower temperatures. Oxygen, nitrogen, and probably
    carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide are present throughout all ranges
    of temperature. Nitrogen is a rather frequent but not very abundant
    constituent of the volcanic gases. How far it results from admixture
    of the atmosphere and how far it is original, is not determined. It
    is, however, one of the gases found in volcanic rocks after they have
    cooled, and is presumably original in part. A large series of secondary
    vapors naturally arise from the volatilization of substances contained
    in the lavas, such as the oxides, chlorides, and sulphides of the
    metals, etc.</p>

  <p><b>Residual gases in volcanic rocks.—</b>Some light upon the vital
    question of the original, as distinguished from the secondary gases
    of lavas may be found in the analyses of the gases that remain in the
    lavas after they are solidified. When the lavas lodged underground
    without free communication with the surface, there is reason to think
    that they retained a larger percentage of their original gases in
    solidification than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">620</span> in cases of free exposure at the surface; at
    any rate, such rocks contain notable quantities of gases occluded
    in some way within themselves. Recent surface-lavas also contain
    gases of similar kinds, but not in equal degree, so far as available
    analyses show. The gases are in part held in numerous small cavities
    within the constituent minerals, especially in the quartz. This is
    perhaps due to the fact that quartz usually crystallizes late in the
    process of solidification, and its mother-material becomes crowded
    with gases excluded by the previous crystallization of other minerals.
    Analyses of twenty-five crystalline rocks of various kinds from many
    typical localities by Tilden,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> gave an average volume of gas,
    under ordinary atmospheric pressure, four and a half times that of
    the containing rock. This shows the condensed condition in which the
    gases are held. Of these gases, the chief is hydrogen, which much
    exceeds all the rest. Next in order of abundance is carbon dioxide,
    followed by carbon monoxide, marsh gas (CH<sub>4</sub>), and nitrogen. Water
    is frequently present and free oxygen almost universally absent.
    The average ratio of hydrogen to carbon dioxide by volume in these
    analyses is about 70 : 30. Five complete analyses gave the following
    averages: H<sub>2</sub>, 52.134; CO<sub>2</sub>, 34.104; CO, 8.422; CH<sub>4</sub>, 3.224;
    N<sub>2</sub>, 2.072. It will be seen that the gases contained in these rocks
    are in proportions radically different from those of the atmosphere,
    and it is doubtful whether they can be reasonably assigned to any
    other source than the lavas from which the rocks were formed. It is
    to be noted, however, that some sedimentary and meta-sedimentary
    rocks, such as quartzite and quartz-schist, contain similar gases,
    but this may be because the granules of the original rock retain
    them, notwithstanding the secondary processes through which they have
    passed. Analyses of meteorites show essentially the same gases in
    much the same proportions. If evidence of this kind can be trusted,
    the standard original gases of lavas are the elements or compounds
    of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, in the order named, while the
    chlorine and sulphur gases are to be regarded as accessory. Because
    of their intensely energetic and noxious character, these latter
    gases make themselves disproportionately manifest in the vicinity
    of active volcanoes. That they are really not preponderant seems to
    be implied by the fact that the volcanic rains, which are extremely
    copious, are usually fresh, and only in rare cases is the presence of
    the hydrochloric or sulphurous elements sufficient to produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">621</span> noxious
    effects. Volcanic and meteoric data seem to indicate that steam is held
    less tenaciously than the other gases in the magmas as they solidify
    into rocks.</p>

  <p><b>The source of the gases.—</b>As already noted, it is one of the
    outstanding problems of geology to determine (<i>a</i>) how far the
    gases of lavas were possessed by them from their origin, whatever
    that may be, and (<i>b</i>) how far they have been acquired in the
    lava’s ascent to the surface. It is recognized that lavas have the
    power of absorbing gases, and one of the views entertained is that
    surface-waters, percolating through the rocks and coming in contact
    with the ascending column of lava, are converted into steam, which is
    absorbed into the lava and rises with it to the surface. There are two
    phases of this view. (1) The more conservative one supposes that the
    water merely penetrates the fracture zone of the surface of the earth
    through the ordinary means of passage of underground-waters, and so
    makes a comparatively short circuit. Under this view, the steam and
    other gases given forth are not a contribution to the atmosphere and
    hydrosphere, but merely a restoration to them of water and dissolved
    gases previously carried down from the surface. An even narrower view
    is sometimes entertained which supposes that the larger part of the
    water descends through the volcanic cone itself, or immediately about
    its base. The presence of chlorine gases in the volcanic emanations and
    the nearness of most existing volcanoes to the sea have been the basis
    for the idea that sea-water, penetrating to the lava, is a chief source
    of the volcanic gases. (2) The broader phase of the view assumes that
    the waters penetrate not only the outer fracture zone of the earth,
    which is probably limited to five or six miles in depth, but that
    they diffuse themselves through the continuous unfractured zone down
    to depths where temperatures of fusion prevail, and that they there
    enter into combination with the lavas or with hot rock to form lavas.
    It is well known that aqueous vapor facilitates the fusion, or more
    accurately, the mutual solution of the minerals. This view is a part of
    one of the hypotheses concerning the origin of the lavas themselves.</p>

  <p>The opposing view supposes that the gases were in the main original.
    Of this view there are two phases: (1) One supposes that the lavas
    are remnants of an original molten globe which absorbed gases from
    the primitive atmosphere and retained them till the time of their
    eruption. The possible absorption of steam and air into the supposed
    molten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">622</span> globe has been much neglected in current conceptions of
    early conditions. If the lavas of the supposed molten globe absorbed
    proportionately as much water-vapor as the volcanic lavas often
    contain, it would probably take forty or fifty times the present ocean
    and atmosphere to supply them. Any remnants of these original lavas
    might well be supposed to hold gases. Even rocks derived from them by
    deep-seated solidification might retain much gas. (2) The other phase
    of the view assumes that the gases were entrapped when the globe was
    built up of meteoroidal or planetesimal matter, as assumed in the
    accretion hypothesis.</p>

  <p>Under either of the last two views the gases may be said to be primary,
    and genetically connected with the origin of the lavas themselves. Such
    gases would be a contribution to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.
    This view does not exclude the idea that as the lava rises through the
    surface-rocks, other gases are formed by contact, and that they may be
    absorbed into the rising column. On the contrary, the view recognizes
    the possibility that a tongue of lava rising into the upper formations
    may encounter bodies of water, or masses of thoroughly water-soaked
    rock, from which great quantities of steam may be generated, and that
    this accessory steam may be a large factor in the initial explosion
    which often accompanies the development of a new volcano, or the new
    eruption of an old one after a long period of quiescence.</p>

  <p>A decision on the vital question whether the volcanic gases are largely
    primary, or are essentially secondary, has not yet been reached;
    but it will doubtless be reached when a sufficient number of really
    representative analyses of volcanic gases have been made, and when the
    phenomena of the gases occluded in igneous rocks have been thoroughly
    investigated.</p>

  <p>The peculiar proportions of the rock-gases, in which hydrogen and
    carbon dioxide so greatly preponderate, seem to imply that they are
    not derived from the atmosphere; at least if they were so derived,
    there must have been a selective absorption of a most remarkable kind,
    because hydrogen is present in the atmosphere in exceedingly small
    quantities, while carbon dioxide is a very minor constituent. At the
    same time, as already remarked, no free oxygen is usually found in
    these absorbed gases.</p>

  <p>The question as to whether the larger part of the volcanic gases is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">623</span>
    original or is merely a special form of convective circulation, has an
    important bearing on the supply of the atmosphere, which is constantly
    being depleted by the oxidation of the rocks and by the formation of
    carbonates and carbonaceous deposits. This vital phase of the subject
    will receive further consideration. While recognizing the lack of
    decisive proof, it would seem that the preponderance of evidence lies
    in favor of the view that a notable portion, at least, of gaseous
    volcanic emanations is derived from the interior of the earth, and
    is really a contribution to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. The
    hydrogen, on coming in contact with the atmosphere, ignites and adds
    itself to the hydrosphere. The carbon dioxide is in part decomposed by
    plants, and adds to the supply of atmospheric oxygen. The nitrogen,
    being comparatively inert, doubtless gradually accumulates in the air
    and has thus come to be its preponderant constituent.</p>

  <h3>THE CAUSE OF VULCANISM.</h3>

  <p>The extraordinary facts involved in volcanic phenomena cannot well be
    discussed fully until the origin of the earth is considered, and the
    great agencies, as well as the peculiar conditions, which the earth
    inherited from its birth, are duly weighed, for these were, with little
    doubt, the true causal antecedents of vulcanism. We shall return to
    the subject after a sketch of the early conditions of the earth, but
    the views that have been entertained may be reviewed here while the
    phenomena are fresh in mind.</p>

  <p>The explanation of vulcanism involves two essential elements. These
    are (1) the origin of the lavas, which involves a consideration of the
    necessary temperatures, pressures, and other conditions, and (2) the
    forces by which the lavas are expelled.</p>

  <p>Nearly all current explanations of vulcanism are founded upon
    conditions supposed to be derived from a molten globe, and fall under
    two general classes: (I) those which assume that the lavas are residual
    portions of the original molten mass, and (II) those which assign the
    lavas to the local melting of rock.</p>

  <h4>I. <i>On the Assumption that the Lavas are Original.</i></h4>

  <p>In this case it is not necessary to assume any special accession of
    heat, but merely to account for extrusion. There are two phases of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">624</span>
    this view, (1) the one postulating a general molten interior, (2) the
    other limiting the molten matter to local reservoirs.</p>

  <p><b>Hypothesis I. Lava outflows from a molten interior.—</b>In the early
    days of geology, when the earth was supposed to have a thin crust and
    a molten interior, it was very naturally assumed that volcanoes were
    but pipes leading down to the molten mass within. This view has been
    essentially abandoned. The independence of adjacent vents is in itself
    almost a fatal objection, when it is recalled that the height of recent
    volcanic craters ranges from nearly 20,000 feet above the sea, to
    10,000 to 20,000 feet below. The view would involve the conception of
    lava-columns connected with a common reservoir varying possibly 30,000
    to 40,000 feet in altitude, and certainly more than half that much,
    simultaneously. The lower outlets should as certainly be selected for
    the outflow of the great interior sea of fluid rock, as the lowest
    sag in the rim of a lake for its outflow, for no great differences in
    specific gravity are presumable under this hypothesis. An equally grave
    objection arises from tidal strain. If the earth were liquid within and
    merely crusted over by a shell of rock of moderate thickness, it would
    yield appreciably to tidal stresses, and this yielding would change the
    capacity of the interior so that with every distortion of the spheroid
    a portion of its fluid interior would be forced to the outside, and
    with every return to the more spheroidal form there would either be
    a re-flow to the interior or a shrinking of the crust. In any case a
    very demonstrative response to tidal influence would tell the story of
    interior fluidity. No such effects are observed. The tidal strains may
    perhaps have a slight effect in hastening a given eruption when the
    forces are approaching a delicate balance and an eruption is imminent,
    but the very triviality of this influence implies not only the absence
    of a general liquid interior, but also of extensive reservoirs.</p>

  <p><b>Hypothesis 2. Lavas assigned to molten reservoirs.—</b>A
    modification of the preceding view has been made to escape the
    difficulties involved in the hypothesis as stated above. It is supposed
    that while nearly all the subcrust solidified, numerous liquid spots
    were left scattered through it. This honeycombed substratum is supposed
    to connect the continuous outer crust with a central solid body,
    solidified because of pressure in spite of its high temperature. This
    hypothesis escapes only a portion of the objections. For instance, the
    lavas in Mauna Loa and Kilauea in Hawaii differ nearly 10,000 feet in
    height,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">625</span> and hence cannot well be supposed to connect with the same
    reservoir, but they are both on the same vast cone, which implies
    at least an equally large molten reservoir as its source. If there
    were two distinct reservoirs of the required magnitude, they must be
    singularly placed to supply vents so near and yet so independent. The
    difficulty grows greater when the whole Hawaiian chain is considered,
    for the points of eruption seem to have migrated from the northwesterly
    islands, where the volcanoes are old, to the southeastern end, where
    volcanic activity is now in progress.</p>

  <p>It would be natural under this view to suppose that these residuary
    lakelets of liquid rock should be gradually exhausted as time goes
    on, and that vulcanism should be a declining phenomenon. It is not
    clear that this is the case. The great number of existing volcanoes in
    regions where great extrusions took place in earlier ages does not seem
    to be in harmony with the hypothesis.</p>

  <h4>II. <i>On the Assumption that the Lavas are Secondary.</i></h4>

  <p>The serious difficulties that arise in interpreting volcanic lavas
    as remnants of an original molten mass, and the strong arguments of
    recent years for a very solid earth, have turned inquiry chiefly
    toward the second class of hypotheses, which refer the origin of
    lavas to the local melting of deep-seated rock. These differ widely
    among themselves. One group seeks for a cause of the melting in
    the penetration of surface air and water; another, in the relief
    of pressure; a third, in crushing and shearing; a fourth, in the
    depression of sediments into the heated interior zone; and a fifth, in
    the outward flow of deep-seated heat.</p>

  <p><b>Hypothesis 3. Lavas assigned to the reaction of water and air
      penetrating to hot rocks.—</b>As steam is one of the great factors in
    the explosions of volcanoes, and as water reduces the melting-point of
    rocks, it is a natural and simple view that water penetrating through
    the fissures and pores of the outer crust and coming into contact with
    the heated rocks below, is absorbed into them and renders them liquid,
    and that then, being rendered swollen and lighter by the process, they
    ascend and discharge quietly or explosively according to the special
    conditions of the case. Naturally the suggestion arises that the waters
    would be converted into steam long before they could reach rock hot
    enough to be melted, and that this steam would be forced back along
    its own track, as the line of least resistance, rather than force
    itself into the rock material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_626">626</span> and rise in the lava-column; but to
    this it is answered that an experiment of Daubree’s has shown that
    water will penetrate the capillaries of sandstone against high steam
    pressure and add itself to the steam within. The fact is also cited
    that certain substances, when highly heated, absorb gases which they
    give out when they cool. The absorption of hydrogen by platinum, and
    of oxygen by molten silver, are illustrations. It is certain that the
    lavas do contain large quantities of absorbed gases, and that these
    are partly, and in most cases largely, given out in cooling, when the
    cooling takes place at the surface. The presumption is that the lavas
    would take the gases up again on remelting under similar conditions.
    If the lavas of actual volcanoes had the temperatures of aqueo-igneous
    fusion (700°–1000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>) only, it would strengthen this view; but as
    temperatures of lavas often exceed 2000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, and probably sometimes
    reach 2500° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, and perhaps 3000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, it is not easy to account
    for such temperatures under this hypothesis, because they would only
    be reached at levels far below those at which aqueo-igneous fusion
    might be presumed to take place. Perhaps this could be met by invoking
    pressure which might prevent even aqueo-igneous fusion from taking
    place until these temperatures were reached, but pressure brings in a
    grave difficulty in another line, as we shall presently see.</p>

  <p>There is a phase of the water-penetration hypothesis which seeks to
    account for an accession of heat. It is affirmed that the outer rocks
    are oxidized, while the inner ones were not originally, or at least
    not completely oxidized, and that air and water from the surface,
    reaching the unoxidized zone, enter into combination and generate the
    necessary heat. This view was pardonable before the development of
    modern thermo-chemistry, but is now quite untenable, as may be shown by
    working out the reactions thermally.</p>

  <p>All views which assign the penetration of surface air or water as
    a cause meet with a grave, if not insuperable, difficulty in the
    condition of the lower part of the earth’s crust (see <a href="#Page_218"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 218</a>). The
    fractured condition of the crust, which permits a ready penetration of
    water, is a very superficial phenomenon. Below the first few thousand
    feet the crevices and porosities of the rock are rapidly closed by the
    pressure of overlying rock, and all appreciable crevices and pores
    probably disappear at a depth of five or six miles. The effective
    function of fissures is, therefore, limited to the upper few miles of
    the crust, and even here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">627</span> to certain portions only. The great pressures
    in gas- and oil-wells show that in many quite superficial beds, even
    when arched, there are no fissures or pores capable of letting even
    gas escape effectively. The depths at which the temperatures of lavas
    are reached are usually estimated, from the downward increase of
    temperature, at 20 to 30 miles. This leaves from 14 to 24 miles of the
    compressed zone between the lowest assignable limit of the fissured
    zone, and the highest assignable zone for the origin of lavas. This
    thick zone of dense rock must be reckoned with in all hypotheses that
    involve the penetration of air and water from without, and, as well,
    the extrusion of lavas from within. In addition to the difficulties
    of the penetration of ground-water, the limitations of its heat, at
    penetrable depths, also bear adversely (see <a href="#Page_219"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 219</a>), on the descent of
    air and water.</p>

  <p><b>Hypothesis 4. Lavas assigned to relief of pressure.—</b>It seems
    to be demonstrated that pressure raises the melting-point of average
    rock, and hence at twenty or thirty miles’ depth there may be rocks
    hot enough to melt at the surface, but still solid because of high
    pressure. If this pressure were in some way relieved they would become
    liquid. Pressure may be locally relieved somewhat (1) by denudation,
    (2) by certain phases of faulting, (3) by anticlinal arches, and (4) by
    continental deformation.</p>

  <p>(1) In most cases of denudation, cooling below probably keeps pace
    with loss above. At any rate, many volcanoes rise from the bottoms
    of the oceans where no denudation takes place, and this phase of the
    hypothesis is not workable there.</p>

  <p>(2) The theory of relief by faulting finds encouragement in the fact
    that many volcanoes occur on fault-lines. There is no evidence,
    however, that this is a universal or necessary relation. Computation as
    to the amount of lowering of the melting-point that might arise from
    the faulting associated with volcanoes indicates that it is necessary
    to suppose that the rocks were already very close to the melting-point
    when the faulting took place, to make the doctrine applicable. It is
    to be observed that in faulting the relief of pressure on one side
    of the fault-line is likely to be balanced by increased pressure on
    the other side, and that this difference in pressure may be lost by
    distribution at a depth of 20 or 30 miles, where, at the nearest, this
    delicate relation between solidity and liquidity, on which the theory
    is dependent, may perhaps be reached.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">628</span></p>

  <p>(3) Immediately under an anticlinal arch there may doubtless be some
    relief of pressure within the limits of strength of the arch, which is
    not great (<a href="#Page_582"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 582</a>). The pressure under the arch <i>as a whole</i> is
    greater than before it was bowed up by lateral thrust, and in depth
    this excess becomes distributed so as to obliterate the local relief
    under the center of the arch, and so <i>adds</i> the effects of folding
    to the average pressure of the crust. Besides, as a matter of fact,
    volcanoes do not appear to be especially associated with mountain folds
    where arching reaches its best expression.</p>

  <p>(4) The same general considerations bear on the assignment of
    liquefaction to relief of pressure in connection with the more general
    deformation of the earth’s body. Besides, while relief of pressure
    might account for liquefaction, it leaves the extrusion without an
    obvious cause; indeed, it would seem to furnish a condition opposed to
    extrusion, and if pressure were subsequently added to force the liquid
    out, it would tend to restore the solid condition.</p>

  <p><b>Hypothesis 5. Lavas assigned to melting by crushing.—</b>Mallet<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
    and others have attributed melting to the crushing of rock. Crushing,
    in the ordinary sense of the term, can only take place in the zone of
    fracture, and that is apparently too shallow to meet the requirements
    of the case. Below this zone, the pressure on all sides is too great to
    permit any separation of fragments, and a solid mass can only change
    its form by what is called “solid flowage.” The rock under these
    conditions may be compressed, and this compression must give rise to
    heat, but at the same time the melting-point is raised, according to
    all experiments. It seems improbable that melting can be produced in
    this way. If great pressure could be brought to bear upon a tract of
    rock so as to heat it by compression, and if then the pressure were
    relaxed before the heat generated could be distributed by conduction,
    and if re-expansion did not follow, possibly melting could be effected,
    but this makes the process complicated and apparently inapplicable. It
    is scarcely possible that such a sequence of events can have affected
    all the tracts that are now volcanic, much less all those that have
    been such throughout geologic history. As noted in the preceding
    case, relaxation would seem to be unfavorable to expulsion. Besides,
    volcanoes do not seem to be confined to tracts that show signs of great
    crumpling and crushing, as the Alps, the Appalachians, and the closely
    folded ranges generally. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_629">629</span>Extrusions seem rather more common with
    faulted ranges where crushing is less notable and where surface tension
    replaces compression.</p>

  <p><b>Hypothesis 6. Lavas assigned to melting by depression.—</b>It is
    observed that in certain regions great thicknesses of sediments have
    accumulated by the slow settling of the crust below, and as these
    sediments obstruct the outward flow of heat while the lower beds settle
    nearer to the interior source of heat, it is conceived that they become
    heated below and, being saturated with water, take on aqueo-igneous
    fusion and rise as lavas, well supplied with internal gas and steam
    from the water and volatile constituents that were entrapped and
    carried down with them. The question obviously arises whether such
    depression is sufficient to give the temperatures the lavas show,
    and whether volcanic action is confined to such areas of depression
    and deep sedimentation. At the highest credible estimates—which are
    none the less to be taken with reserve—the post-Archean sediments
    rarely reach five or six miles in thickness at any given point, and
    probably never exceed ten or twelve, while twenty or thirty miles is
    the computed depth required for the acquisition of the temperatures
    the lavas actually possess. If the Archean terranes be included among
    the sedimentaries, the thickness may be adequate, but what then of the
    Archean vulcanism, which much surpasses that of later times, and the
    other early extrusions before the sediments were thick; and what of the
    moon, where there are probably no sediments at all?</p>

  <p>Besides, it is not at all clear that the distribution of vulcanism is
    specially related to that of thick sediments, as it should be if this
    hypothesis were the true one. There are many volcanoes in the heart of
    the great oceans where sedimentation is now inappreciable, and probably
    has been in all past periods.</p>

  <p><b>Hypothesis 7. Vulcanism assigned to the outflow of deep-seated
      heat.—</b>If the earth grew up by slow accessions of meteoroidal or
    planetesimal matter, in a manner to be more fully set forth in the
    discussion of the origin of the earth, and if its interior heat be due
    chiefly to compression by its own gravity, the internal temperature
    would be originally distributed according to the degree of compression,
    and this would depend on the intensity of the internal pressure. This
    can be approximately computed, and is shown in the diagram on page 563,
    where this subject has been treated. On not improbable assumptions
    regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_630">630</span> thermometric conductivity, the flow of heat from the
    deep interior to the middle zone would be greater than the loss of
    this zone to the superficial zone. This middle zone should, under
    this view, experience a rising temperature. By hypothesis, this zone
    is composed of various kinds of matter mixed as they happened to fall
    in. Hence as the temperature rises, the fusion-points of some of these
    constituents will be reached before those of others. More strictly,
    the temperatures at which some of these constituents will mutually
    dissolve one another will be reached, while other constituents remain
    undissolved, and thus a partial and distributed liquefaction will
    arise. The gases and volatile constituents in the mixed material would
    naturally enter largely into the liquefied portion. It is assumed
    that with a continued rise of temperature, the partial liquefactions
    would increase until the liquefied parts found means of uniting, and
    the lighter portions, embracing the gaseous contingent, were able to
    work their way toward the surface. As they rose by fusing or fluxing
    their way, the pressure upon them became less and less, and hence the
    temperature necessary for liquefaction gradually fell, leaving them a
    constantly renewed margin of temperature available for melting their
    way through the upper horizons. Thus it is conceived that these fusible
    and fluxing selections from the middle zone might thread their ways up
    to the zone of fracture and thence, taking advantage of fissures and
    fractures, reach the surface. It is conceived that such liquefaction
    and extrusion would carry out from the middle zone the excess of
    temperature received from the deeper interior, and thus regulate its
    temperature and forestall general liquefaction, the zone as a whole
    remaining always solid. The independence of volcanoes is assigned
    to the independence of the liquid threads that worked their way to
    the surface. Nothing like a reservoir or molten lake enters into the
    conception. The prolonged action of volcanoes is attributed to the
    slow feeding of the liquid threads from the locally fused middle zone.
    The frequent pauses in action are assigned to temporary deficiencies
    of supply; the renewals to the gathering of new supplies after a
    sufficient period of accumulation. The distribution of volcanoes in
    essentially all latitudes and longitudes is assigned to the general
    nature of the cause. The special surface distributions are assumed to
    be influenced, though not altogether controlled, by the favorable or
    unfavorable conditions for escape presented by the crustal segments of
    the earth. The persistence of volcanic action in time is attributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_631">631</span>
    to the magnitude of the interior source, to its deep-seated location,
    and to the slowness of conduction of heat in the earth’s interior. The
    force of expulsion is found in the stress-differences in the interior,
    particularly the periodic tidal and other astronomic stresses (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
    580), and in the slow pressure brought to bear on the slender threads
    of liquid by the creep of the adjacent rock. The violent expulsions are
    due to the included gases, of which steam is chief. Little efficiency
    is assigned to surface-waters, and that little is regarded as wholly
    secondary and incidental. The true volcanic gases are regarded as
    coming from the deep interior and as being true accessions to the
    atmosphere and hydrosphere. The standing of the lavas in volcanic ducts
    for hundreds and even thousands of years with only small outflows,
    as in some of the best-known volcanoes, is regarded as an exhibition
    of an approximate equilibrium between the hydrostatic pressure of
    the deep-penetrating column of lava, and the flowage-tendency of the
    rock-walls, the outflow being, of course, also conditioned on the
    slow rate of supply below, and the periodic stress-differences of the
    interior.</p>

  <p>For the present these hypotheses must be left to work out their own
    destiny, serving in the mean time as stimulants of research. All but
    the last have been for some time under the consideration of geologists,
    and are set forth in the literature of the subject (<a href="#Page_636"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 636</a>).</p>

  <p>A few special phases of the problem need further discussion, though
    they have been incidentally touched upon.</p>

  <h4><i>Modes of Reaching the Surface.</i></h4>

  <p>All of the views that locate the origin of the lavas deep in the earth
    must face the difficulties of the passage through the dense portion of
    the sphere below the fracture zone. Near the surface, the lavas usually
    take advantage of fissures or bedding-planes already existing or made
    by themselves. There is little evidence that they bore their way by
    melting, though they round out their ducts into pipes as they use them,
    much as streamlets on glaciers falling into crevices round out moulins.
    But this use of fissures and bedding-planes for passage is probably
    merely a matter of least resistance where the lavas are relatively
    cool, and their capacity for melting is low or perhaps even gone.
    Daly has recently urged that lavas work out reservoirs and enlarge
    passageways for themselves by detaching masses of rock from the roofs
    and sides of the spaces already occupied by them, these masses either
    melting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_632">632</span> and mingling with the lava, or else sinking to lower positions
    in the column. This process he designates <i>stoping</i>.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

  <p>In the denser and warmer zone below, the alternatives seem to be (1)
    melting or fluxing, or (2) mechanical penetration without fracture. As
    rocks “flow” in this zone by differential pressure without rupture,
    an included liquid mass may be forced to flow through the zone by
    sufficient differential pressure. If local differential pressures at
    the surface be neglected as probably incompetent, there only remain the
    stress-differences of the interior and the differences of hydrostatic
    pressure between the lava-column and the surrounding solid columns.
    The latter would not be great until a column of liquid of much depth
    was formed, and the former would probably not be concentrated on the
    liquid in such a way as to force it bodily through the solid rock.
    Probably fusing or fluxing its way with the aid of stress-differences
    is the chief resource of the lava in the initial stages. In this it
    may be supposed to be assisted by its gases, by its selective fusible
    and fluxing nature, by its very high temperature if it comes from
    very great depths, as held in the seventh hypothesis, and by the
    stress-differences which prevail in the deep interior, as shown in the
    last chapter. In ascending from lower to higher horizons, the lava
    would be constantly invading regions of lower melting-point because of
    less pressure. It would thus always have an excess of heat above the
    local melting temperature until it invaded the external, cool zone,
    where the regional temperature is below the melting-point of surface
    pressure. From that point on it must constantly lose portions of its
    excess of temperature by contact with cooler rocks, and probably in
    the process of fluxing its way in the compact zone. If this excess is
    insufficient to enable it to reach the zone of fracture, the ascending
    column is arrested and becomes merely a plutonic pipe or mass. If
    it suffices to reach the zone of fracture, advantage may be taken
    thereafter of fissures and of rupturing, and the problem of further
    ascent probably becomes chiefly one of hydrostatic pressure, in which
    the ascent of the lava-column is favored by its high temperature
    and its included gases. The hydrostatic contest is here between the
    lava-column, <i>measured to its extreme base</i>, and the adjacent
    rock-columns, <i>measured to the same extreme depth</i>. The result
    is, therefore, not necessarily dependent on the flowage of the outer
    rocks, but may be essentially or wholly dependent on the deep-seated
    flowage <span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">633</span>of the rock of the lower horizons. The ascending column may
    reach hydrostatic equilibrium before it reaches the surface, and may
    then form underground intrusions of various sorts without superficial
    eruption, or it may only find equilibrium by coming to the surface and
    pouring out a portion of its substance and discharging its gases.</p>

  <h4><i>Additional Considerations Relative to the Gases.</i></h4>

  <p>The question whether the volcanic gases are a contribution to the
    atmosphere and hydrosphere is so important in its bearings on the whole
    history of the atmosphere as to merit additional consideration here. As
    already noted, if the volcanic gases arise from water and absorbed air
    that have previously passed down through the strata, there is no real
    contribution to the hydrosphere and atmosphere, but merely circulation.
    If the gases are chiefly derived from the deep interior, they are an
    important accession to the atmosphere and hydrosphere.</p>

  <p>Most views are more or less intermediate, assigning a part of the
    gases to the interior and a part to the exterior. No one will question
    that some part at least of the steam is due to the contact between the
    ground-waters and the hot lava, and probably no one will question that
    some gas comes from the interior if the lavas originate there. The
    vital question is, whence comes the major portion? Are the constant
    ebullitions of some volcanoes and the terrific explosions of others due
    mainly to surface-waters, or to interior gases?</p>

  <p>It seems to be certain that in most cases the gases are diffused
    through the substance of the lava, and are not simply in contact with
    the walls of the column or with its summit. Without doubt steam is
    generated around the lava-column by external contact, and perhaps some
    explosions are due to the entrance of the rising lava upon a crevice
    or cavern filled with water, or to the invasion of a lake gathered in
    an old crater; but it still remains a question whether the importance
    of such explosions has not been exaggerated. Such action does not
    seem competent to produce <i>inflated</i> lavas, but merely shattered
    ones. Water thus “suddenly flashed into steam” could scarcely diffuse
    itself intimately through the lava, for the process of diffusion is
    exceedingly slow. But inflated lavas, pumice, scoriæ, and cinders are
    the typical products of explosive vulcanism. Not only in the ordinary
    Vesuvian type, but in the extraordinary Krakatoan type, inflated lavas
    are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_634">634</span> dominant product. Prodigious quantities of this covered
    the sea about Krakatoa after its tremendous explosion in 1883. Judd
    estimates that the volume of included steam involved in the inflation
    of the pumice examined by him, was from three to five times that of the
    rock, and that the amount involved in exploding the lava into the fine
    dust that floated in the upper atmosphere for months, was presumably
    much greater.</p>

  <p>If the sudden flashing into steam of bodies of water in external
    contact with hot lava be rejected as only an incidental source of
    explosion, it remains to be considered whether waters permeating the
    rock and becoming converted into steam may not be absorbed into the
    rising lava, become diffused through it, and ascending with it, explode
    at the surface. So far as access through fissures and cavities large
    enough to be entered by lava are concerned, it may safely be concluded
    that since the hydrostatic pressure of the lava must be greater than
    that of the water in the fissures, or else it could not rise, the lava
    will enter them, forcing back the water or the steam generated from
    it, and, having penetrated as far as accessible, will solidify as a
    dike, and plug up the avenue of contact between the ground-water and
    the portion of the lava still remaining molten. The numerous dikes
    that attend volcanic necks testify to the prevalence of this action.
    The capillary pores of the wall-rock, which cannot be thus bodily
    occupied by the lava, must doubtless become filled with steam, and
    this, following the principles of Daubree’s experiment, will force
    itself into contact with the lava and be absorbed by it, but whether
    this will be in sufficient quantity, and will become sufficiently
    diffused through the body of the lava-column to produce the observed
    effects, is an open question. The increasing testimony of deep mining
    is that relatively little water flows through the deeper horizons.
    It is urged that the water remaining in solidified lavas is very
    unequal in distribution, as though due to unequal access and partial
    diffusion. The argument seems strong, but to make it thoroughly good,
    it must be shown that this inequality is not due to <i>irregularity of
      discharge</i> of the gases during and after eruption, rather than to
    irregularity of original <i>accession</i>. There is, perhaps, as much
    ground for assigning differences in the degree of parting with the
    included gases, as in acquiring them. Doubtless those lavas that boiled
    and seethed for a long period in the caldron were more fully deprived
    of their gases than those that were more promptly disgorged and cooled
    with less convection and surface exposure.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_635">635</span></p>

  <p><b>Thermal considerations.—</b>Probably the most important
    consideration relates to the heat effects. If underground-waters enter
    the lava-column and come forth as steam, great quantities of heat are
    consumed in the process. Has the lava a sufficient excess of heat to
    stand this? Can ebullition be maintained for the observed periods if
    the steam comes from ground-waters?</p>

  <p>Many lavas probably do not carry a very large excess of heat above
    that necessary for liquefaction, for not a few of them contain
    crystals already forming, which shows that they are within the range
    of the temperatures of solidification of their constituents. The same
    conclusion is indicated by the limited fusing effects shown by the
    walls of dikes and sills. On the other hand, as already remarked,
    dikes and sills often show the effects of a rather rapid cooling from
    the walls. The method of flow often implies the same condition for
    the acidic lavas, since they usually behave as stiff, pasty masses
    of limited liquidity. On the other hand, the basic lavas, whose
    fusion-point is much lower, often flow freely and reach great distances
    before solidifying. The facts taken altogether imply that the average
    temperature of the lavas is not much above the fusing-point of the
    acidic lavas, while it may probably be very considerably above the
    fusing-point of basalt. For a rough estimate, with no pretensions to
    accuracy, it may be assumed that in an average case there are 500°
    <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> excess, but probably not 1000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> A computation based on even
    so rough an estimate as this may, by showing the order of magnitude
    of the thermal considerations, indicate their radical bearing. The
    average temperature of the ground-water of the upper two or three miles
    of the crust—the only portion through which water probably penetrates
    with sufficient freedom to be effective in this case—is probably less
    than 200° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> The specific heat of rock appears to average somewhat
    less than 0.2. The temperature of the lava may be taken at 3000° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>
    as a sufficiently high average. From these data it follows that if
    an amount of ground-water equal to five percent. of the volume of
    the lava entered the lava and was brought up to its temperature and
    then discharged, the temperature of the whole mass would be lowered
    550° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> It is therefore evident that only a small percentage of
    surface-water can pass through the lava consistently with its continued
    fluidity.</p>

  <p>M. Fouqué estimated that the discharge of steam from a merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">636</span>
    <i>parasitic cone</i> of Etna during 100 days was equal to 2,100,000
    cubic meters of water. If this were ground-water, and the lava from
    which it issued had an excess of 500° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr> above the fusion-point, the
    formation of this steam would congeal a column 400 feet in diameter
    and 3000 feet deep in the time given. If this case is typical, and
    if Fouqué’s estimate is not greatly exaggerated or very exceptional,
    the view that any large portion of the steam from volcanoes comes
    from surface-waters seems to be incompatible with the persistence of
    ebullition and explosion which many of them exhibit. Stromboli has been
    in constant eruption as far back as the history of the region runs. It
    is now exploding every three to ten minutes, and yet the mass of lava
    seems to be small and its outflow inconsiderable. Is it possible that
    a current of steam, given out with this activity for so long a period,
    was derived from adjacent ground-waters, and has not yet solidified the
    lava?</p>

  <p>The problem takes on a very different aspect if the steam, or at least
    some large part of it, rises from great depths and brings thence an
    excess of heat. It then becomes an agency for the maintenance of
    the liquidity of the lava, for giving it convective motion, and for
    promoting explosive action, so long as it continues to rise.</p>

  <p>For these and other reasons the balance of present evidence seems to us
    to favor the view that most of the steam and other gases come with the
    lava from its original source deep in the earth.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE GEOLOGIC FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.</div>

  <h4>I. THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF ORGANIC PROCESSES.</h4>

  <p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no reason to suppose that life processes, as we know them,
    were in operation in the earliest stages of the earth’s history. They
    were introduced and developed gradually during its progress. With
    life there came into the processes of the earth’s development three
    distinctive factors:</p>

  <p>A. Certain chemical actions giving rise to compounds that are not known
    to occur independently of life.</p>

  <p>B. Certain modes of aggregation of material, and certain kinds of
    bodily movements, not known except in association with life.</p>

  <p>C. The mental element, under the direction of which certain new
    processes were inaugurated, and certain previous processes were
    modified and controlled.</p>

  <h5><span class="smcap">A. The Chemical Work of Life.</span></h5>

  <p>The peculiar chemical phenomena connected with life chiefly concern
    the carbon compounds. In the inorganic world the carbon compounds are
    few and simple. In the organic world they become extremely numerous
    and complicated. These compounds are very unstable, for the greater
    part, and their partial decomposition gives rise to many additional
    compounds. Some of the true organic compounds and some of their
    decomposition products have the power of combining with inorganic
    substances, and so produce an additional series of semi-organic
    combinations. The total number of the compounds thus directly and
    indirectly connected with life greatly exceeds that of all inorganic
    compounds. Their mass, however, is very greatly inferior.</p>

  <p><b>Life material chiefly atmospheric.—</b>In the building up of the
    organic compounds, a necessary step is the decomposition of certain
    inorganic compounds. The chief of these is the carbon dioxide of the
    atmosphere and hydrosphere, the decomposition of which furnishes
    the carbon needed for the organic compounds. On this account carbon
    dioxide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">639</span> may be regarded as in some sense the basal material or the
    fundamental food of the organic kingdom, and hence it plays a radical
    rôle in the life-history of the earth.</p>

  <p>Water, and the constituents of water, oxygen and hydrogen, play a
    larger part quantitatively, but a less distinctive part.</p>

  <p>Nitrogen is also an essential element, and usually stands next to
    carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in quantity.</p>

  <p>These, it will be noted, are all atmospheric constituents, and the
    material of life is, therefore, dominantly atmospheric. This is
    even true of aquatic life, for it lives largely on the atmospheric
    constituents dissolved in the water. The function of life, considered
    from the material point of view, is not only fundamentally concerned
    with the atmosphere, and intimately dependent on its conditions, but
    its most important material effects appear to lie in its modification
    of the constitution of the atmosphere.</p>

  <p><b>The non-atmospheric factors.—</b>The atmospheric constituents
    are not, however, the only elements intimately connected with the
    life function. Compounds of sulphur, phosphorus, potassium, sodium,
    chlorine, iron, calcium, magnesium, silicon, and other elements are
    more or less essential to the life of many organisms, or are employed
    by them for their skeletons, coverings, etc. Incidentally, nearly all
    the common elements become intimately related to living organisms
    either in the relations of active elements in their physiological
    functions, or of passive elements in their structure or in their
    auxiliary parts.</p>

  <h6><i>Three Classes of Effects.</i></h6>

  <p>Out of life processes grow three rather distinct classes of results:
    (1) changes in the amounts and proportions of the constituents of
    the atmosphere and, to some slight extent, of the hydrosphere and
    lithosphere; (2) aid or hindrance to inorganic processes, such as
    disintegration, erosion, and deposition; and (3) distinctive products,
    either (<i>a</i>) of organic matter that would not have come into the
    existing combination but for life, such as peat, lignite, amber, etc.,
    or (<i>b</i>) of special forms of inorganic matter that would not have
    arisen but for life, such as coral deposits, shell-marl, diatom ooze,
    etc.</p>

  <h6>(1) <i>Changes in the composition of the atmosphere.</i></h6>

  <p>The succession of modifications which the atmosphere has undergone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">640</span>
    from time to time through the action of life will be discussed as the
    earth’s history is followed in the second volume. It may suffice here
    to note briefly the chief ways in which the atmosphere has probably
    been modified by the agency of life, not only as regards its quantity
    but also as regards the proportions of its constituents.</p>

  <p><b>The consumption and restoration of carbon dioxide.—</b>As the
    fundamental food of the organic world, carbon dioxide has suffered
    enormous consumption in the course of the geological ages, and is now
    reduced to the very small proportion of .0004 or .0003 of the whole.
    At the outset it was probably one of the most abundant constituents;
    possibly even the chief one. It has been partially restored,
    concurrently with its consumption, by animal respiration, by certain
    classes of plant action, and by combustion and other forms of inorganic
    combination. This restorative action has been incomplete at all known
    stages of the earth’s history, and hence there has been constant loss
    of carbon dioxide. The inorganic processes which have also profoundly
    affected both the consumption and restoration of carbon dioxide are
    here neglected and discussed elsewhere.</p>

  <p><b>The freeing and consumption of oxygen.—</b>The oxygen of the
    atmosphere is actively consumed by animals and by plants, but on the
    other hand, it is set free abundantly by green plants, and hence its
    amount has probably fluctuated from time to time according to the state
    of balance between the organic processes of its production, and those
    of its consumption. The consumption of oxygen by organic processes is,
    however, little more than a reversal of the previous process by which
    it was set free; for instance, green plants in forming their food set
    free the oxygen of the carbon dioxide used for the purpose. When the
    organic substance so formed is ultimately consumed through plant or
    animal action or by inorganic means, an equivalent amount of oxygen
    reunites with the carbon to again form carbon dioxide. And so if the
    whole of the organic matter is returned to the inorganic state, no more
    oxygen is consumed than had been before set free in the process of
    forming the organic matter. But, as a matter of fact, a large amount
    of organic matter has not gone back completely to the inorganic state,
    and this residue constitutes a factor of no small importance in the
    geological record.</p>

  <p><b>The organic residue.—</b>There is a certain portion of vegetation
    that is not consumed by animals or by other plants, and that escapes
    combustion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">641</span> and all kinds of ordinary decay, and this constitutes a
    part of the organic residue. Animals never completely oxidize all
    the organic matter they take into their systems; their bodies never
    entirely consume themselves. A like statement may be made respecting
    those plants that feed on organic matter. That which animals and plants
    leave unoxidized is indeed more or less preyed upon by other animals
    and plants, and relatively little escapes final reoxidation, but there
    is a remnant, and this constitutes another part of the organic residue.
    The more conspicuous forms of the organic residue are found in the
    mucks, peats, lignites, coals, organic oils, and gases, but in addition
    there is not a little disseminated organic matter in nearly all the
    sedimentary rocks; in the aggregate, this probably amounts to more than
    the distinct organic deposits.</p>

  <p><b>The meaning of the organic residue.—</b>All the unoxidized, or
    incompletely oxidized, carbon in the organic residue implies that
    oxygen has previously been separated from this residual carbon by
    plants and given to the atmosphere, and hence has been a source of
    atmospheric enrichment in oxygen. The amount thus contributed is
    equal to that which is required to restore the residual carbon to its
    original state of oxidation. So, in a similar way, the unoxidized
    hydrogen in the organic hydrocarbons and like compounds implies that
    oxygen has been separated from the hydrogen of water and given to the
    atmosphere, and hence this also is a source of atmospheric enrichment
    in oxygen. It seems safe, therefore, to conclude that the action of
    life, taken as a whole, has increased the free oxygen of the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>While not here under consideration, it is not to be forgotten that
    inorganic processes involving the same atmospheric constituents have
    been in operation concurrently with the organic processes, and that
    they have also affected the amounts and proportions of the atmospheric
    constituents. Rocks have been oxidized in greater or less measure
    at the expense of the atmospheric oxygen, and hence when the total
    atmospheric problem is considered, there arises the question whether
    the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has been increased or diminished
    during geological history, when the balance is struck between the
    inorganic and the organic actions. The probabilities seem to us to
    strongly favor the view that organic action has preponderated, and that
    the oxygen has been increased beyond its primitive amount, but that it
    has fluctuated during known geological history. The reasons for this
    view will appear in the historical chapters.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_642">642</span></p>

  <p>The disintegration of the crystalline rocks and the solution of
    limestone have consumed much carbon dioxide, and this is to be added to
    the loss through organic action. On the other hand, there are inorganic
    processes that supply carbon dioxide, and hence when the larger problem
    of the atmosphere is raised, the factors become so complicated that
    their consideration is best deferred to the historical chapters. This
    passing reference may stand us in good part lest we forget, for the
    moment, the inorganic factors in the atmospheric problem.</p>

  <p><b>The more inert factor.—</b>Nitrogen in the free state is relatively
    inert chemically, and it does not appear that it can be used directly
    by the higher plants and animals in appreciable amounts. Certain
    bacteria, and perhaps certain algæ<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and other low forms of plants,
    have the power of using free nitrogen, and this is a principal way in
    which it is put within the reach of higher plants. Nitrogen is also
    combined in small quantity in the atmosphere by electric action, and
    thus made available for plants. On account of the inertness of nitrogen
    and of the relatively limited amount required for organic purposes,
    the nitrogen of the atmosphere has been less consumed than the carbon
    dioxide. Besides this, the nitrogen compounds are very decomposable,
    and are very generally and completely returned to their original state.
    Deposits of nitrates or other nitrogenous compounds are relatively rare.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that if there is any considerable source of supply
    concurrent with this slight loss, the amount of nitrogen in the
    atmosphere must have been increasing. We have seen that volcanoes give
    forth considerable quantities of nitrogen, and that this <i>may</i>
    be a real addition to the atmosphere, and not merely a return of
    the atmospheric nitrogen that had been carried down previously by
    underground-water. It has also been noted that crystalline rocks
    contain occluded nitrogen, which is doubtless freed by their
    disintegration. It is, therefore, not improbable that the nitrogen of
    the atmosphere has been increasing, both actually and relatively.</p>

  <p><b>Probable fluctuations of atmospheric composition.—</b>With this
    general sketch of the interplay of the atmospheric elements under
    organic influence, we are prepared for the further conception that if
    one or another of these actions was relatively more vigorous than usual
    for a period, it would bring about a variation in the proportions of
    the atmospheric constituents. If, for example, vegetation flourished
    luxuriantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_643">643</span> for a long period, but was measurably protected from
    the organisms that preyed upon it and from inorganic decomposition,
    as by falling into water or by prompt burial under sediment, the
    atmosphere might be growing richer in oxygen. If, on the other hand,
    vegetation were being relatively reduced, as <i>perhaps</i> it is
    being reduced now by man, and if previous organic products were being
    reoxidized at an unusual rate, as they are now in the burning of
    timber, coal, natural oil and gas, the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere
    might be relatively increasing, while the oxygen might be relatively
    diminishing. The possible fluctuations of the atmosphere as the result
    of organic action are, therefore, matters of vital importance, and
    invite attention in the historical study of the earth and in the
    outlook into its future.</p>

  <p><b>The climatic effects of organic action.—</b>Interest does not,
    however, rest at this point. The researches of physicists have
    made it probable, if they have not altogether demonstrated, that
    the composition of the atmosphere has much to do with the climatic
    conditions at the surface of the earth. The atmosphere blankets the
    earth and equalizes its temperature. Acting as a screen, it subdues in
    some measure the intensity of the sun’s rays by day, while it retards
    the radiation of the earth’s acquired heat at night. This is in some
    measure the function of all the constituents of the atmosphere, but
    by no means of all equally. The oxygen and nitrogen are relatively
    diathermous, letting the sun’s rays pass in freely, and the earth’s
    rays pass out freely; but carbon dioxide and the vapor of water are
    much less diathermous, particularly to rays of low intensity, such as
    are thrown out by non-luminous bodies like the earth. It follows that
    while the solar rays come in rather freely and heat the surface of
    the earth, the dark rays which the earth radiates back are measurably
    arrested by the carbon dioxide and vapor of water, and serve to keep
    the air warm. The influence of the vapor of water is vividly shown in
    the different degrees to which cooling takes place at night in a dry
    and in a moist atmosphere, respectively, where other conditions are
    the same. Ice is said to form at night in desert regions where the air
    is extremely dry, even within the tropics, while in humid regions of
    the same latitude and altitude oppressively hot nights are common. The
    influence of the carbon dioxide is not thus familiarly demonstrated,
    since its amount varies but slightly in different localities, but
    physical experiment indicates that it has a similar function.</p>

  <p>If the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere varies from age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_644">644</span> to
    age, the climate of the earth must apparently vary accordingly, and on
    this is built one of the hypotheses of climatic variation subsequently
    to be considered. We shall find that there have been great changes in
    the climate of the earth during its history. There is good evidence
    of former glaciation, not only in the northern United States and in
    England, Germany, and central Russia, but in India, Australia, and
    South Africa. At other times, figs and magnolias grew in Greenland
    and Spitzbergen, and corals flourished in the Arctic seas. There is
    good evidence of arid periods where humidity now prevails, and of
    humid periods where aridity now prevails. It is not assumed that the
    influence of organic action on the atmosphere has been the sole, or
    perhaps even the main, cause of these great climatic changes, but it is
    believed that it has been an important contributing factor. It is even
    possible that the climate of the future is much dependent on the agency
    of man, as implied above, however little ground there may be to suppose
    that he will, with altruistic purpose, control his action with a view
    to its bearing on the generations that may live tens of thousands of
    years hence.</p>

  <h6>(2) <i>Aid and hindrance to inorganic action.</i></h6>

  <p><b>The promotion of disintegration.—</b>While the influence of organic
    action on the lithosphere is quite superficial, and far less radical
    than that on the atmosphere, it is still important. Plants promote
    both disintegration and disaggregation under certain conditions,
    and hinder them under others, as already set forth. Chemical action
    of a decomposing and solvent nature takes place in connection with
    the roots of plants, while their growth sometimes rends rocks into
    whose crevices they have insinuated themselves. The acids and other
    products of organic growth and of organic decomposition attack some
    of the constituents of the rocks and contribute to their solution and
    disintegration. On the other hand, organic matter entrapped in the
    sediments, and so introduced into the strata at various depths, often
    acts as a reducing agency, causing the deposit of substances carried in
    solution in the underground-waters. Ores are sometimes thus formed, as
    explained in the discussion of ore-deposits (<a href="#Page_476"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 476</a>). Organic action
    on the whole promotes solution and disintegration at the surface, and
    prepares the way for deposition below.</p>

  <p><b>Protection against erosion.—</b>Another important function of
    vegetation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">645</span> is the protection of the land surface against erosion,
    as already noted in the discussion of erosion. A mantle of grass,
    especially if it forms a turf, or a carpet of leaves protected by bush
    and forest, greatly retards surface wash. It does this not only because
    it directly covers the soil, but because it holds back the run-off
    and tends to prevent those violent floods which give to erosion its
    greatest intensity. There is a marked difference between the erosive
    work which a given amount of water will do if, in the one case, it runs
    off gradually, and in the other, precipitately. By way of offset, it is
    to be noted that the disintegrating action of vegetation prepares the
    rock material for easy erosion, and to this extent helps in its removal
    by the drainage; but on the average this is greatly overbalanced by the
    protection afforded by the vegetal covering, though this is not true in
    every instance.</p>

  <p><b>The influence of land vegetation on the character of the
      sediments.—</b>The presence or absence of a vegetal covering influences
    the kind of deposit which is derived from the land, particularly
    if the surface be occupied by crystalline rocks. If the surface be
    well clothed with vegetation, the crystals of the complex silicates,
    such as the feldspars, micas, and ferromagnesian minerals, are
    usually disintegrated into clayey products before they are removed,
    so that, when borne away and deposited, the result is common shale.
    Concurrently, the relatively undecomposable quartz-grains are rounded
    into sand, and deposited as common quartzose sandstone, while the
    calcareous material is borne away in solution and deposited as
    limestone. But if the surface be bare of vegetation, the crystalline
    rocks are usually <i>disaggregated</i> before they are decomposed,
    for destructive action works best at the junctions of crystals, and
    along cleavage lines, and hence the crystals are usually separated
    from one another before they are fully decomposed. In the absence of a
    covering to hold them in place until they are decomposed, they are apt
    to be washed away, and the resulting deposit consists in considerable
    part of grains of feldspar, mica, hornblende, and other minerals,
    which do not usually occur in well-decomposed sediments. The deposits
    are, therefore, of the nature of arkose, if the original rocks are
    granitic, or of the nature of wacke, as the term is used in this book,
    if they are of the basic type. On this is based the inference that a
    vegetal covering of the land extended as far back in the history of the
    earth as clay shales, quartzose sandstones, and limestones form the
    prevailing sediments.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">646</span></p>

  <h6>(3) <i>Distinctive deposits.</i></h6>

  <p><b>Organic rocks.—</b>In the chapter on the origin and descent of
    rocks, a group of rocks formed directly from organic matter is
    recognized and described. The chief of these are peat, lignite,
    bituminous coal, anthracite, and graphite. It is the belief of many
    geologists that natural gases, oils, and asphalts are also mainly
    derived from animal and vegetal remains. An alternative view, advocated
    by Mendelejeff and Moissan, assigns the oils, gases, etc., in part
    at least, to deep-seated carbides to which water has gained access
    and developed hydrocarbons, after the analogy of acetylene.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
    Whatever may be the truth relative to inorganic action, it is clear
    from geological conditions that some of the natural gases and oils
    are organic products. Besides the more common organic deposits, there
    is a long list of minor products, among which are amber, copalite,
    paraffine, ozocerite, camphene, etc. Guano and coprolites represent the
    excrementitious class.</p>

  <p><b>Inorganic rocks due to life.—</b>Besides these deposits of organic
    matter, or of its decomposition products, there is a large class formed
    from the inorganic matter that served auxiliary functions in the
    economy of life, such as shells, skeletons, etc. For the greater part
    these are composed of calcium carbonate, and give rise to limestones,
    marls, chalk, etc. Not a few, however, are silicious, and give rise
    to flints, cherts, and silicious earths. Some are formed of calcium
    phosphate, and a few of other inorganic material. The deposits formed
    in these ways have been defined in the chapter on rocks.</p>

  <h6><i>Fossils.</i></h6>

  <p>The term <i>fossil</i> is used so comprehensively as to include not
    only the remains of plants and animals themselves, but their tracks,
    impressions, casts, replacements, and all other distinct traces.
    It also embraces nests, borings, implements, and other distinctive
    products. These enter into the formation of the two classes of rocks
    just considered, but they have an independent function. They constitute
    the specific record of life, and their study not only reveals much of
    the past history of plants and animals, but furnishes one of the most
    important means by which the ages of formations are determined. In the
    early development of the science it was found that the uppermost and
    hence the latest beds <span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">647</span>of rock contain fossil forms either identical
    with those now living, or closely similar to them; that beds below
    these bear life relics that depart somewhat more from the living forms,
    and are somewhat less highly developed; that beds still lower bear
    fossils that depart still more from the living types, and are more
    primitive in general, and so on down as far as fossils are found.</p>

  <p><b>The general order of life succession determined by
      stratigraphy.—</b>Thus it appeared from the evidence of the strata
    that there was a general order of life succession. It was also found
    that this was, <i>in its main features</i>, the same for all the
    continents. By continued and close studies, the particulars of the
    succession were worked out more and more fully, and the work is still
    being pushed forward to greater and greater degrees of refinement. At
    the same time, it was found that there were different faunas and floras
    in different parts of the world in past times, much as there are now;
    that there were shiftings and migrations as now; that given species
    were increasing in some regions and dying out in others, and that
    innumerable variations and complications entered into the evolution and
    distribution of the life forms. But under and through all these there
    run a sufficient number of common features to show beyond reasonable
    question the order of succession of life.</p>

  <p>Throughout all this study, <i>the chief guide was the actual order</i>
    in which the fossils were found in the succession of strata, because
    there is no evidence so conclusive of the order of events as the
    superposition of the sedimentary beds when they are normal and
    undisturbed. By the study of the fossils in the successive beds, it was
    found that there was a more or less progressive evolution of plants and
    animals brought about by modifications of their forms, and that these
    modifications assisted in determining the order of succession when
    the evidence of the strata was defective; and so the biological and
    stratigraphical factors reacted helpfully on each other.</p>

  <p><b>Fossils as means of correlation.—</b>While stratigraphy was thus,
    in the earliest stages, the main reliance in determining the order
    of events, and biology was the chief gainer, in the end stratigraphy
    received ample compensation, if indeed it did not become the greater
    beneficiary; for at no known and accessible place is there a complete
    succession of sedimentary beds. There are great series here and there,
    but their connections with one another are more or less concealed
    by surface formations or water-bodies. So also at many places the
    stratified series has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_648">648</span> been broken up by deformation, or cut away by
    erosion. Hence there was need for some reliable means of matching the
    beds of separated series, and of making up a complete ideal series.
    This means is found in the fossils they contain. While the variations
    of the faunas and floras in different regions, and their migrations,
    introduce some minor difficulties, the relations of the fossiliferous
    beds of one region to those of another can be determined with great
    satisfaction, and often with great precision. This is particularly so
    when abundant floating or free-swimming species lived in the seas and
    were freely fossilized, for they were deposited on the coasts of all
    the continents at practically the same time, and no uncertainties from
    migration or local differences in rate of evolution intervened to throw
    doubt upon the correlation. Without the aid of fossils, the correlation
    of the deposits on the separate continents would be attended with
    grave obstacles and much uncertainty, if not with quite prohibitive
    difficulties.</p>

  <h5><span class="smcap">B. Special Modes of Aggregation and of Movement.</span></h5>

  <p>Inorganic solid matter is chiefly crystalloidal; organic matter is
    chiefly colloidal; but there are colloidal states of inorganic matter
    and there are crystalloids among the organic products. In the inorganic
    world, solids very generally tend to organize in the form of crystals;
    in the organic world, they as generally tend to organize in the form of
    cells. Neither tendency is complete or exclusive, but each is dominant
    in its own sphere.</p>

  <p>Still more distinctive than the formation of cells is the growth of
    complex organized bodies, the differentiated members of which perform
    special functions for one another, and are mutually dependent on one
    another. This is a profound departure from the habitual modes of the
    inorganic world.</p>

  <p>Still more so is the power of voluntary motion in more or less
    disregard of outside physical influences. Through this power,
    distribution may take place contrary to current and wind, and
    to gravitation itself. From the view-point of past geologic
    transportation, this is perhaps more singular than important, for no
    great mass of matter has been transported contrary to the influences
    of gravity, wind, and current, by the exercise of this peculiar
    power of animals, but it is not without geologic importance in the
    migrations and in the redistributions of organic influences that arise
    from migrations. When the influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">649</span> man is included, the geologic
    effects require consideration, but here the third distinctive factor,
    the mental element, comes into effective play, and we pass to its
    consideration.</p>

  <h5><span class="smcap">C. The Mental Element.</span></h5>

  <p>Current opinion does not recognize a mental element as residing in the
    plant world, and it is divided as to the degree of its development in
    the lower animal kingdom, but its influential presence in the higher
    animal orders and in man is beyond legitimate question. Two phases
    are to be recognized: (1) the material work done under the stimulus
    and direction of mental impulses, as, for example, excavations,
    transportations, changes of drainage, removal of forests, cultivation
    of soil, etc., and (2) the intellectual work of the faculties
    themselves irrespective of material changes. In one view, geology
    is a purely material science concerned solely with the formation of
    the earth and with the physical development and relations of its
    inhabitants. In another, geology is a comprehensive historical science
    concerned with every phase of the world’s history, and certainly
    not least with the higher forms of life development, with their
    psychological, sociological, and other phases of mental attainments,
    since these are the highest output of the earth’s evolution. The latter
    seems to us the more comprehensive view.</p>

  <p>(1) <b>The material effects of the mental element.—</b>Lyell long since
    urged that the direct work of man in changing the face of the earth was
    slight compared with that of the contemporaneous inorganic agencies.
    He called attention to the relative insignificance of the quarries,
    pits, cellars, and other excavations of man, compared with the work
    of streams, waves, and other inorganic agencies. There is justness in
    this view, but it needs qualification. It is to be observed that the
    mental era has but just begun, and that its effects are increasing
    with a rapidity quite phenomenal when measured by the slow pace of
    most geologic events. The excavations and transportations of material
    to-day show an enormous advance on those of Lyell’s day, which was,
    geologically speaking, but a moment ago. The mile-tons of industrial
    freightage in the Mississippi basin are to-day not wholly incomparable
    with the drainage transportation of the same area a century ago. A
    century ago is named, because the surface was then covered with natural
    vegetation, and the normal effect of surface erosion, independent of
    man, was then experienced. At present the indirect effects of man’s
    action are mingled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">650</span> those of natural processes, and these indirect
    effects are probably much more important than the direct ones. The
    removal of the native vegetation and the cultivation of the soil
    expose the surface to wash to a degree far beyond that prevalent when
    the surface was prairie sod, or leaf-carpeted forest, and denudation
    and transportation have been greatly multiplied in consequence. Not
    only has this cultivation increased the exposure to erosion, but, by
    increasing the rate of run-off, it has added to the erosive power
    of the streams. The ditching of swamps and other tracts of retarded
    drainage has contributed to this acceleration. The naked, soil-less
    uplands of some of the once populous kingdoms of the Orient, notably
    portions of Syria and Greece, are sad witnesses of the accelerated
    erosion that attends cultivation. The erosion of certain southern
    fields of the United States in the last forty years is another striking
    illustration. It is doubtful whether some parts of this region suffered
    as much erosion in the preceding five centuries as they have during
    the last one. On the other hand, some compensation is found in the
    reservoirs established for water-power, and in artificial devices for
    retarding and steadying stream flow.</p>

  <p>In the light of considerations such as these, man may well be regarded
    not only as a potent geological agent, but as dangerously so to
    himself. The hope is that the intelligence that has wrought a change
    of surface conditions serviceable for the present, but dangerous to
    the future, will be so enlarged as to inspire a still more intelligent
    control of surface conditions which shall compass the future welfare as
    well as transient benefit.</p>

  <p><b>Human modification of the animal and vegetal kingdoms.—</b>Man’s
    agency is also coming to be felt powerfully in the modification of the
    plant and animal life of the land and even to some extent of the sea.
    The larger animals that are not propagated by man are fast approaching
    extinction. At the present rate of extension of man’s dominion, a
    century or so will see the disappearance of nearly every large mammal
    and reptile that he does not choose to protect or propagate. By way
    of compensation, certain selected animals are increasing and will
    doubtless continue to increase. The result is, therefore, likely to
    be a peculiar assemblage of animal life dependent strictly on the
    choice of a dominant type, a state of things that has apparently never
    occurred in an equal degree in the past history of the earth. How far
    the minor forms of life, especially the insect life, and the denizens
    of the sea, may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">651</span> be brought under this monopolistic control may not be
    predicted so easily.</p>

  <p>A similar profound transition in vegetation is being forced by man. The
    native vegetation is rapidly being replaced by selected varieties, and
    by varieties that take advantage of conditions furnished by man. As the
    agricultural control of the earth becomes more complete and effective,
    a result toward which very rapid progress is being made, a new flora
    of man’s selection will very generally prevail over the whole land
    surface of the globe. It is doubtful whether at any time in the history
    of the earth changes of flora and of fauna, and of surface, have been
    more rapid than those that are now taking place under the accelerating
    influence of man’s action, and this accelerating influence springs
    not mainly from automatic or instinctive reaction, but from conscious
    impulse and intelligent direction.</p>

  <p>(2) <b>The psychological factors as such.—</b>Are the introduction and
    the evolution of the psychological factors themselves to be regarded
    as subjects of geological study? We shall find that, at the outset,
    the geologic record is a complete blank so far as clear evidence of
    terrestrial organisms actuated by their own intelligence is concerned;
    that later, organisms with some apparent consciousness and intelligence
    appeared, and that the mental element increased apace unto its present
    attainment. We know that relationships of a sociological nature arose
    in apparent feebleness, and gradually evolved into more definite,
    higher, and more complex forms. By sociological factors we mean merely
    those conscious relations which one organism bears to another, of
    which the parental and the gregarious impulses are two fundamental
    expressions. For manifest reasons, the introduction and evolution of
    the psychological and sociological factors themselves have received
    little direct recognition as a portion of geological studies. The
    record of such factors in the fossils of past ages is necessarily
    obscure and imperfect, and the interpretation of what there is lacks
    certainty and precision. None the less, this psychological record,
    with all its imperfections, is beyond valuation, and must, we think,
    come to be an indispensable factor in the study of psychological and
    sociological evolution, for it shows, what nothing else can show
    equally well, the extremely prolonged history of that evolution, and
    it gives hints of modes and means which no study of existing stages
    can equally reveal. The organization of the Cambrian trilobites,
    for example, implies no small development of the senses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">652</span> and of the
    coordinating faculties even at that early stage, and a study of the
    relations of these to their fellow creatures opens up the first
    known chapter in the sociological record of the earth’s inhabitants.
    From this stage onward the progress in the development of the higher
    faculties, and of the sociological relations of the leading forms, is
    one of the most instructive phases of the great history. Such a study
    reveals the fact that many questions, narrowly supposed to be purely
    human, have had their prototypes in the earlier experiences of the
    animal kingdom. Some of these questions have found solutions, temporary
    or permanent, which passed under the test of ages to whose length human
    experience affords no parallel, and have received the sanction or
    disapproval of such tests according as they were well or ill adapted to
    the actual conditions involved. If one seeks the lessons of history in
    the largest sense, he cannot wisely neglect the prolonged record of the
    great biological family.</p>

  <h3>II. SPECIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE ORGANIC KINGDOMS.</h3>

  <p>An essential part of the historical chapters of the second volume will
    consist of the description and illustration of the life progress of the
    successive periods. It will suffice here to give a preliminary synopsis
    of the kinds of record made by the several groups of plants and animals.</p>

  <h4><span class="smcap">A. Contributions of the Plant Kingdom.</span><a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></h4>

  <p>The record of plants in the early geological ages is extremely
    imperfect. In the very earliest times the conditions seem to have been
    wholly unsuited to the preservation of any relics of life; but even
    after animal remains were abundantly preserved in the sea sediments,
    the plant record was still very meager for a long period. This was
    probably due in the main to two chief causes: (1) the probable
    softness and perishability of the early types of vegetation, and (2)
    the fact that vegetation is preponderantly terrestrial. At no time
    has marine vegetation reached a high development. Land conditions
    favor decomposition, transportation, and erosion, and through these,
    destruction; and only under rather occasional and exceptional
    conditions did the old lands leave a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_653">653</span>good record of their life.
    Nevertheless all the great groups of plants, viz. the Thallophytes
    (algæ, fungi), the Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts), the Pteridophytes
    (ferns, horsetails, lycopods), and the Spermatophytes (gymnosperms,
    angiosperms) have left some record.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Thallophytes (algæ, fungi,
    bacteria).—</b>The Thallophytes embrace the simplest types of plants,
    and are probably the nearest present representatives of the ancestral
    forms. Some of them are minute one-celled organisms, as simple as an
    organism can well be conceived to be. The simple blue-green algæ of
    our fresh waters well represent this class. The most are, however,
    multicellular, and some (as the great seaweeds) rise to a degree of
    complexity and of a bodily segmentation resembling that of the higher
    plants. The various species are adapted to an extremely wide range
    of conditions; some live in hot springs at 170° <abbr title="Fahrenheit">Fahr.</abbr>, and some in
    Arctic seas at the freezing-point; some flourish in fresh water, some
    in brackish, some in salt water, and some even out of the water. This
    wide adaptation implies an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">654</span> ancient and plastic type. The fact that
    they flourish in waters so hot and sometimes also so sulphurous as to
    be fatal to most plants, suggests the possibility of their introduction
    during the very early volcanic stages of the earth, while conditions
    were yet uncongenial for other plants.</p>

  <p>The geologic work of the thermal algæ is well shown in the beautiful
    travertine and sinter deposits of the Yellowstone Park (<abbr title="Figures">Figs.</abbr> <a href="#fig215">215</a> and
    <a href="#fig218">218</a>). At the Mammoth Hot Springs the deposits are calcareous, while
    at most of the other hot springs silicious deposits are formed, in
    both cases partly, but not wholly, by the aid of algæ. The beautiful
    yellows, reds, browns, and greens of these springs are not mineral
    coloring, but living plants.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In the calcareous waters, the algæ
    are believed to cause the deposition of calcium carbonate from calcium
    bicarbonate by consuming the second equivalent of carbon dioxide
    that rendered the carbonate soluble.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> In the silicious waters, the
    process of deposition is not understood. Similar deposits by the
    aid of algæ take place in the geyser regions of Iceland and of New
    Zealand, in the hot springs of Carlsbad, where they have been well
    studied by Cohn,<a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> and in most other hot springs. The same, or very
    similar, forms of algæ abound in nearly all waters, fresh and salt,
    but the question whether they make calcareous and silicious deposits
    in notable quantity appears not to have received as yet the critical
    investigation its importance deserves, except in a few special cases.
    It is clear, however, that in the cool waters such deposits do not
    reach the conspicuous amounts that they attain in the thermal springs.
    In the shallow waters of the ocean, especially in the warmer regions,
    lime-secreting algæ are abundant and make large contributions to the
    lime deposits.</p>

  <p>Among the higher algæ are the lime-secreting corallines or nullipores
    (Rhodophyceæ, red algæ), once regarded as animals, which contribute
    a notable part of the calcareous substance of coral reefs. They are
    important geologic agents in the temperate and tropical seas, and have
    been traced as far back in time as the early Paleozoic era.</p>

  <p>The Challenger reports<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> describe two forms of minute calcareous
    spherical organisms, Rhabdospheres and Coccospheres, as very
    abundant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">655</span> in the surface-waters of the temperate and tropical seas,
    and as important in contributing to the calcareous deposits of the
    sea-bottoms. The affinities of these bodies are in doubt, but they are
    regarded by Murray as probably pelagic algæ.</p>

  <p>The stoneworts (Characeæ), an aberrant group of algæ inhabiting fresh
    and brackish water, secrete notable quantities of calcium carbonate
    in and around their tissues, and the accumulation of these gives rise
    to marl or limestone. It has recently been urged that our so-called
    shell-marls are mainly due to Charæ,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> the molluscan shells being
    incidental rather than essential constituents.</p>

  <p>In very ancient and also in some of the later strata, there are
    limestones that do not carry any visible fossils, and their origin is,
    therefore, debatable. There are also not a few limestones that are made
    up of a fine-grained base through which are scattered molluscan shells,
    corals, etc., in a fine state of preservation. The condition of these
    fossils bears rather adversely on the view that shells, etc., have been
    powdered in sufficient numbers and to a sufficient degree to form the
    compact base. In all these cases the usual explanations leave something
    to be desired. It is worth considering whether low forms of plants may
    not be among the undemonstrated agents in forming these apparently
    unfossiliferous limestones or parts of limestones. The calcium
    carbonate deposited by the algæ is in minute and delicate form, and is
    usually crystalline while yet in the living tissues. It is, therefore,
    easily subject to comminution and to such further crystallization as
    would obscure the minute features that constitute the evidences of
    algal origin.</p>

  <p>The more complex and conspicuous algæ, the seaweeds, have left
    impressions of their stems and fronds on the marine beds of most of the
    periods, but they are usually obscure. Seaweeds are perhaps the source
    of the vegetal matter in certain carbonaceous shales and limestones. As
    seaweeds extract bromine and iodine and certain metallic ingredients
    from the sea-water, some of the iodine and bromine springs issuing from
    ancient marine deposits, and certain ores, may owe their origin to
    ancient seaweeds.</p>

  <p>Diatoms, minute plants of the Thallophyte group, secrete a delicate
    framework of silica which becomes a contribution to the silicious
    deposits. Diatoms have sometimes contributed the material for very
    considerable beds, such as those of the ooze-bogs now forming in the
    marshes of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">656</span>geyser basins of the Yellowstone Park,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and the
    diatom oozes of the deep sea (<a href="#fig353"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 353</a>, <a href="#Page_425"><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 425</a>).</p>

  <p>Fungi, for obvious reasons, have left but scant traces of themselves.</p>

  <p>Bacteria are believed to be recognizable as far back as the Paleozoic
    era. They are now the chief agents in the decomposition of organic
    matter, and may be regarded as the prime enemies of the fossil record.
    It is probable that similar decomposition took place actively in the
    earliest ages, for otherwise the remains of the ancient organisms
    should be more abundant. There is hence a theoretical probability that
    bacteria flourished as far back as the stratigraphic record goes.
    Not unlikely they were originally simple algæ that turned from the
    primitive habit of making their own food, to living on other organisms
    or their remains, and in so doing lost their power of manufacturing
    chlorophyll and of using inorganic carbon compounds. Their remarkable
    adaptation to the most varied conditions, and their extraordinary
    ability to endure the greatest vicissitudes of environment, support the
    view that they are a very ancient and plastic form.</p>

  <p>At present certain bacteria are important to higher vegetation because
    of their ability to use the free nitrogen of the atmosphere and to
    combine it into forms available for the higher plants. It is not
    improbable that they have subserved this important function through
    all the known ages. Some experiments seem to show that certain of the
    existing algæ have this power, and possibly the ancestral forms of
    plants possessed it. The bacteria, being a derived and not an original
    form, could not have performed the function for the first plants. It is
    possible, of course, that the inorganic supply of nitrogen compounds
    was sufficient for plant life at the outset.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Bryophytes (liverworts, mosses).—</b>The
    mosses and liverworts have left no certain record of their work in the
    earlier and middle geologic eras, and, if they existed at all, their
    contributions were unimportant. Although low forms of plant life,
    they are not primitive ones, as they are characterized by a definite
    alternation of generations implying a considerable time antecedent to
    the attainment of their present forms; hence there are no very cogent
    theoretical reasons for assigning them a place in early geologic
    history, though their absence cannot be affirmed. Some botanists think
    the Pteridophytes were derived from some ancestral form of liverwort,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">657</span>which, if true, would require the presence of the latter in an early
    geologic period; but the negative geological evidence relative to
    their presence favors the alternative view that the Pteridophytes were
    derived from some form of the Thallophytes by an independent line. In
    recent times, certain of the mosses, especially the sphagnum mosses,
    have played a notable part in the formation of peat accumulations. For
    this, their habit of growing in bogs, and of dying below while they
    continue to grow above admirably fits them.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Pteridophytes (ferns, horsetails, lycopods,
    Sphenophyllum).—</b>The Pteridophytes include the most important
    fossil plants of the earlier and middle geologic eras. To them we
    owe chiefly the great carbonaceous deposits of the Coal Measures and
    probably most of the disseminated carbons of the early and middle
    eras; perhaps also much of the natural oil and gas. Their special work
    is so conspicuous that it will be noted at length in the chapters on
    the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and hence may be passed here
    with brevity. The ferns, now known more for their beauty than their
    importance, are the representative type of the group, and are really
    a wonderful family, having preserved their characteristic leaf-forms
    with a persistence attained by no other group of plants. The Paleozoic
    ferns are recognizable as such by every one, irrespective of botanical
    knowledge; indeed it is the detection of the differences, rather than
    the resemblances, between the ancient and modern forms, that requires
    expert knowledge. This continuity shows that since their introduction
    the changes of climate have never been so great as to prevent their
    propagation, without radical modification, in some part of the globe,
    and this fact rather narrowly limits the range of surface temperatures,
    and of other climatic vicissitudes. The persistence of the Equisetæ
    (horsetails, scouring-rushes) and the lycopods (club-mosses) bears
    like testimony, as does the persistence of life in general; but the
    rather delicate ferns are perhaps more obviously significant than most
    organisms.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Spermatophytes (seed plants, including
    gymnosperms or “evergreens” and angiosperms or “flowering
    plants”).—</b>The angiosperms, the dominant group to-day, make
    their appearance in the record in the latter part of the Mesozoic
    era, and their contribution is, therefore, relatively modern. They
    contributed to the coals, lignites, oils, and organic gases of the late
    geological periods, as did the Pteridophytes in the earlier periods,
    the latter participating, however, in the late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span> deposits. Perhaps the
    most important function of the Spermatophytes lay in their superior
    serviceability as food for the higher land animals, by virtue of their
    seeds, fruits, and foliage. Neither the Thallophytes, Bryophytes, nor
    Pteridophytes, nor all combined, approach the Spermatophytes in food
    value for the higher types of animal life, and it is doubtful whether
    the higher evolution of the land animals could have taken place without
    the previous introduction of the seed plants. It will be noted in the
    historical narrative that the great placental group of mammals came in
    and deployed with marvelous rapidity, as geological progress goes, soon
    after the Spermatophytes became the dominant form of vegetation.</p>

  <p><b>Plant life terrestrial rather than marine.—</b>It is to be noticed
    that the chief development of all the great groups of plants took place
    on the land, or in the land-waters, rather than in the sea. This is
    preeminently true of the higher types, and appears also to be true of
    even the Thallophytes, although the number of individual algæ and their
    total mass is very much greater in the sea than on the land and in the
    land-waters. But the fresh-water algæ appear to possess in a higher
    degree than the marine forms those plastic and germinal characters
    from which new forms spring, and are probably to be regarded as the
    parental type. These are facts to be pondered on, since it has been
    the current opinion of geologists that life arose in the sea and was
    propagated thence to the land. The alternative view that life developed
    primarily on the land and in the land-waters and migrated to the sea is
    not, however, without its support in the plant world, as we thus see,
    and the plant world was the primitive one; the dependent animal world
    necessarily followed its development. The hypothesis of a terrestrial
    origin of life throws a very suggestive cross-light on many geological
    problems, as will be seen later, and it may well be entertained as an
    alternative working hypothesis until the facts are more fully developed.</p>

  <h4>B. <span class="smcap">Contributions of the Animal Kingdom.</span><a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></h4>

  <p>As already noted, animal life is dependent on the decomposition of
    matter organized by green plants, and the conversion of its potential
    energy into active forms. Animals are, therefore, dynamic rather than
    constructive agencies. Nevertheless they transform organic vegetal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span>matter into organic animal matter, and this is sometimes really an
    advance in organization. The organized animal matter is subject to
    preservation in some small degree, though it usually perishes. Some
    contribution is, therefore, made to the organic deposits, chiefly in
    the form of hydrocarbons. It is the view of some geologists that the
    natural oils and gases have an animal origin in the main.</p>

  <p>As dynamic organisms animals have need for supporting- and
    working-frames, for protective covering or housing, and for offensive
    and defensive weapons, and these have been constructed chiefly out of
    inorganic matter, and subordinately of indurated organic matter. It is
    through these that animals have made their chief contribution to the
    material of the geologic record. Skeletons and other hard parts to give
    internal stiffness or firmness; shells, plates, indurated integuments,
    and various other forms of external protection; teeth, spines, horns,
    and other means of gathering and masticating food, and of attack and
    defense, contribute material to the deposits, and form a record of the
    life activities and of the physiographic environment. All of the eight
    groups of animals, viz. Protozoa, Cœlenterata, Echinodermata, Vermes,
    Molluscoidea, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Vertebrata, have left some
    record, but it is in all cases a very imperfect one.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Protozoa.—</b>The Protozoa are related to
    the animal kingdom much as the Thallophytes are to the vegetable, and
    the two bear a close structural resemblance to one another. So near,
    indeed, do the Protozoa and the Thallophytes approach one another in
    their minuteness and simplicity, that the place of not a few organisms
    is in doubt, and the two kingdoms, in general so different, seem here
    to blend in the group Flagellata. The Protozoa are usually very minute
    one-celled organisms with very little differentiation of tissue or
    organs. Of the four classes of Protozoa, only one, the Rhizopoda, is
    found in the fossil state. The rhizopods secrete silicious skeletons,
    and calcareous, silicious, and chitinous tests of a great variety of
    forms, and this gives them geologic importance. The deep-sea oozes and
    the chalk deposits are their best-known contributions at present. They
    have probably played a more important rôle in the formation of ordinary
    limestones and silicious silts than can be demonstrated, because of the
    delicacy of their relics and the ease with which these are pulverized
    by wave-action in the shallow seas, or changed by recrystallization
    or by concretionary aggregation. The globigerina oozes are formed
    largely from the calcareous shells of Foraminifera (<a href="#fig351"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 351</a>), one
    of the orders of rhizopods, among which the genus Globigerina is a
    leading form. Those forms which make the deep-sea oozes live, not on
    the bottom, but near the surface of the open sea, and on the death of
    the organisms, the shells, tests, and skeletons sink to the bottom.
    Chalk is formed in a similar way from calcareous Foraminifera, but not
    necessarily in very deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span> water. Foraminifera live in shallow water as
    well as in the open sea, and in this case they sometimes creep on the
    bottom or are attached to algæ, but their deposits in shallow water are
    usually much obscured by other kinds of deposition and by destructive
    action. Some of the foraminiferal shells are divided into chambers and
    assume various spiral forms, of which the <i>Nummulites</i>, named
    from their resemblance to coins, are notable examples. These formed an
    important part of the nummulitic limestone of the Eocene period.</p>

  <p>The radiolarian ooze is characterized by the silicious tests of various
    members of the silica-bearing order, Radiolaria. The “Barbadoes earth”
    and “Tripoli” are notable deposits of fossil radiolarians.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Cœlenterata.—</b>The Cœlenterata embrace
    the sponges, the coral polyps (Anthozoa), and the hydroids and medusæ
    (Hydrozoa). The contribution of coral polyps to the formation of
    limestone is most important, and is too familiar to require elaboration
    here. The corals range throughout nearly the whole fossiliferous
    series, and their development will be followed and illustrated in the
    historical chapters.</p>

  <p>The sponges are widely represented by their spicules, and not
    uncommonly their aggregate form is preserved even in very ancient
    strata. Their contribution is largely silicious, but is partly
    calcareous. The hydroids and medusæ have left little trace of
    themselves in the rocks, although impressions supposed to represent
    medusæ are found in strata as early as the Cambrian. Certain coral-like
    forms, as the Millepores, Tubularia, and Stromatopora, are classed as
    Hydrozoa. The graptolites, delicate leaf-like floating forms, very
    serviceable in marking exact horizons on different continents because
    of their free distribution, are also classed here.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Echinodermata.—</b>Under the echinoderms
    are grouped the crinoids (sea-lilies), cystoids, blastoids, ophiuroids
    (brittle stars), asteroids (starfishes), echinoids (sea-urchins),
    and holothuroids (sea-cucumbers). This is one of the marked groups
    of ancient as well as modern life, and its beautiful fossils grace
    every period in which life relics are well preserved. The cystoids and
    crinoids, and later the blastoids, were prominent in the Paleozoic
    ages, while the remaining forms were more conspicuous later, though
    early introduced. All divisions, except the holothuroids, whose
    softness prevented, have left a good record, as fossil records go.
    Their relics are chiefly calcareous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">662</span> and they most abound in the
    limestones, some of which are largely made up of their remains, as the
    encrinital limestone (<a href="#fig349"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 349</a>). They will be subjects of frequent
    comment and illustration in the historical chapters.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Vermes.—</b>Most of the worms are ill
    adapted to fossilization and are not known in the fossil form. The
    segmental worms of the sea, the annelids, however, left some traces of
    themselves in tubes and borings and in tracks and sometimes by fossil
    jaws and teeth. They range from the earliest fossil-marked horizons
    onward, but seem to have always been an inferior group.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Molluscoidea.—</b>This group includes the
    bryozoans, whose fossil products closely resemble the minute-celled
    corals, and the brachiopods, whose shells closely resemble those of
    the molluscs. Both are calcareous and make important contributions
    to the formation of limestone (<a href="#fig350"><abbr title="Figure">Fig.</abbr> 350</a>). A few brachiopods secrete
    calcium phosphate instead of calcium carbonate. Both classes have a
    great geologic range and their fossils are valuable aids in identifying
    and correlating formations. Probably the brachiopods are more utilized
    for this purpose than any other single class. They are the symbol of
    conservatism and persistence, ranging from the Cambrian to the present
    time, and embracing some forms that have scarcely changed to the extent
    of generic difference in that time.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Mollusca.—</b>The molluscs have also
    ranged from the earliest well-recorded times, and some divisions,
    as the pelecypods (lamellibranchs, embracing clams, oysters, etc.)
    and gastropods (snails, etc.), have undergone no very marked change
    beyond a rather ample and progressive development; but others, as
    the cephalopods (nautilus, squids, cuttlefish, etc.), mark out the
    progress of the ages by distinct and striking changes of form. Their
    shells are chiefly calcareous and they have contributed materially
    to the formation of limestone. Muddy and sandy bottoms are, however,
    more congenial to the pelecypods and gastropods than to the corals,
    crinoids, and many other limestone-forming types, and hence fossils of
    these molluscs frequently abound in shales and sandstones and give them
    a calcareous element. In sandstones, however, the calcareous matter
    is often dissolved out and only the casts of the shells remain. The
    molluscs will be much cited and illustrated in the historical chapters.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Arthropoda.—</b>This group embraces the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span>
    crustaceans, myriopods, spiders, and insects. The hard parts of their
    bodies are mainly horny or chitinous forms of organic matter, and hence
    their relics differ notably from the inorganic calcareous and silicious
    remains of most of the preceding forms. The Arthropoda did not at
    any time form a notable stratum of rock. Their geologic value lies
    chiefly in what they teach of the progress of life and its relations,
    and the aid they render in correlation and identification. In these
    respects the group is a notable one. It was represented in the early
    fossiliferous strata by the trilobites, one of the most interesting of
    all types of fossils. These were probably the most highly developed
    organisms of their times and give the clearest hints of the stage of
    psychological and sociological development that had been reached when
    first the record of life is opened to us. The record of the myriopods,
    spiders, and insects dates from the middle Paleozoic, and gives the
    first clear hints of animal life on the land.</p>

  <p><b>The contribution of the Vertebrata.—</b>In the vertebrates
    the dynamic or working organism may be said to reach its highest
    expression, unless it be in the flying insects, and their inorganic
    residue becomes relatively unimportant in rock formation. Although the
    greatest of all animal types in most respects, it has never formed more
    than trivial beds of rocks. There are occasional “bone beds,” but they
    are thin and limited in extent, and only partially formed of vertebrate
    matter. The geological importance of the vertebrates lies in the
    higher field of life evolution and in its mental accompaniment. Fishes
    excepted, the vertebrates are mainly land types, and have for their
    chief colleagues plants and insects. The other groups of animals are
    mainly, though not wholly, marine. The vertebrates have little place
    in the Paleozoic record, except near its close, but they dominate the
    Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, and are conspicuously the master type to
    day.</p>

  <h3>III. THE ASSOCIATIONS AND ECOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF LIFE.</h3>

  <h4>A. <span class="smcap">The Basis of Floras and Faunas.</span></h4>

  <p>Geologic interest is not confined to the kinds of plants and animals
    that have lived and the contributions they have made to the deposits,
    but embraces also their assemblage into floras and faunas, and the
    relations of these assemblages to the prevailing physiographic
    features. These assemblages and relationships are among the most
    suggestive factors of the earth’s evolution, and are the most
    instructive for purposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">664</span> of comparison with human history, and for
    forecasting the future of man and of the whole biological kingdom.
    Moreover, floras and faunas, as such, are used in the correlation
    of formations, and in this application they give surer results than
    correlations by individual species. A particular species may live
    far beyond the usual period of a species, and if fossilized in one
    region in its early history and in another in its late history, the
    two formations might be referred erroneously to the same stage. This
    is far less likely to happen with a whole assemblage of forms. There
    is a similar liability to error in interpreting migrations on the
    basis of a single or a few species, for a single species or a few
    species may be transported by unusual or accidental means, so to speak,
    when there is no normal pathway for general migration, and when no
    systematic migration takes place. In most of the great questions that
    arise concerning the connections and disseverances of the continents,
    and concerning the unions and separations of the oceans, which are the
    fundamental causes of the migrations and of the isolations of plants
    and animals, typical floras and faunas are to be studied, rather than
    isolated species or sporadic forms. A brief sketch of the leading
    causes and consequences of these special assemblages of plants and
    animals may aid in appreciating the underlying significance of floras
    and faunas, and in interpreting their meaning as they are met in the
    study of the strata. A part of these grow out of the relations of
    the organisms to one another, and a part out of the relations of the
    organisms to their environment.</p>

  <h5>(1) <i>Assemblages Influenced by the Mutual Relations of Organisms.</i></h5>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Food relations.—</b>The relations of food-supply are
    among the most obvious reasons for assemblages. As animals are
    dependent directly or indirectly on plants for their food, they must
    gather where the plants grow, or in the currents in which the plant
    products are borne. Whatever determines an assemblage of plants also
    causes, or at least invites, an assemblage of animals. Whatever
    causes an assemblage of particular plants, invites an assemblage of
    the particular animals that use these plants. Animals that feed on
    plants are in turn preyed upon by other animals, and these in turn by
    others. A whole train of organisms may, therefore, be gathered into
    a region by the conditions that foster a certain kind of vegetation
    there. In interpreting the physical significance of such a train,
    it is obvious that the head of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span> train carries the fundamental
    meaning. The dependent creatures that follow the primary forms may be
    only incidentally, and perhaps very slightly, adapted to the physical
    environment.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Adaptive relations.—</b>Organisms depending on other
    organisms for food or other necessary conditions of life, present
    many forms of adaptation the better to secure their food and to use
    it. These adaptations are the consequences and the signs of the
    assemblage, and are of the greatest service in interpreting the place
    and significance of the organisms in the assemblage. Teeth usually
    reveal the food of their possessors, and hence teeth are among the
    most significant of fossils. Fortunately their functions require them
    to be hard and durable, and hence well suited to fossilization. The
    growth of low plants into trees forced a notable series of adaptations
    in the animals that fed upon them in the matter of height, of reaching
    members, of climbing, and probably at length of parachuting and flying.
    In these and similar ways the floras and faunas took on special phases
    because of the mutual relations of their members.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Competitive relations.—</b>The assembling of plants and
    animals, with their prodigious possibilities of multiplication, brought
    competition, and with it a struggle for food which often became a
    struggle for existence, and out of this grew innumerable modifications
    of form and habit. These have become so familiar since the great
    awakening caused by the doctrines of Darwin and Wallace that they need
    no elaboration here.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) <b>Offensive and defensive relations.—</b>Within limits,
    plants are benefited by the feeding of animals and respond by
    developing seeds and fruits that especially invite such action, their
    compensation being found in planting and distribution. It is obvious
    that, on the whole, the continued growth of plants is largely dependent
    on the renewal of a supply of carbon dioxide through the agency of
    animals and some plants, bacteria in particular. Otherwise the supply
    would become so reduced as to greatly limit plant life. It has been
    estimated<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> that the whole of the present supply of carbon dioxide
    would be consumed by plants in one hundred years if the consumption
    continued at the present rate and no carbon dioxide was returned. It
    is now well known that the so-called decay by which carbon dioxide is
    freed is due more to microscopic organisms than to inorganic processes.
    It seems clear, therefore, that the continued activity of plants is
    largely due to their consumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">666</span> by animals and other plants. But
    still, though the larger good of plants is conserved by the predaceous
    action of animals, and of certain parasitic and saprophytic plants,
    their individual preservation is often conserved by defensive devices,
    such as thorns, poisons, bitter compounds, etc. This is notably true in
    desert regions where the conditions are hard and the total extinction
    of plants would be threatened if animals were permitted to feed freely
    upon them. Within the animal world, the preying of one form upon
    another is the main source of that great struggle for existence which
    has characterized the whole known history of life, and has been one
    of the influential factors in shaping the evolution of life and in
    modifying the special aspects assumed by the floras and faunas of each
    period.</p>

  <p><b>Implied forms of life.—</b>The full meaning of the fossils of any
    period can only be gathered by duly considering these relationships in
    their interpretation. The existence of animals implies the existence
    of plants in supporting abundance, whether the record contains their
    relics or not; an animal with a protective covering implies an enemy;
    a tooth of a specific kind implies the appropriate class of food,
    etc. While inferences of this kind are subject to error, they are at
    present the only means by which the faunas and floras of most ages
    can be rounded out into a rational assemblage of organisms, that is,
    an assemblage that affords the necessary food for its members and
    an adequate function for the offensive and defensive devices which
    its members present. Only a small part of the life that lived was
    fossilized, and only a small part of the fossils actually carried
    in the strata have been collected, because only a small part of the
    strata are exposed at the surface. The direct record now accessible
    is, therefore, very incomplete and hence the need—and in the need the
    excuse—for adding the forms that are implied by the character of the
    known fossils.</p>

  <h5>(2) <i>Assemblages Influenced by Environment.</i></h5>

  <p>It has been noted that some animals depend for existence on other
    animals; that ultimately all animals depend on plants, and that green
    plants alone can make food directly from inorganic material. Green
    plants, therefore, head the train of dependencies, and their relations
    to the physical conditions that surround them are the primal relations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">667</span></p>

  <p><b>Plant societies.</b><a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>—The control of physical conditions has
    been sufficient to develop special associations or societies of plants
    by fostering those adapted to these conditions and eliminating those
    that are not. Among these are (1) the hydrophytes (“water plants”),
    embracing those that grow in water or in very wet situations; (2)
    xerophytes (“drought plants”), embracing the opposite class, which are
    adapted to very dry situations; (3) mesophytes, including those suited
    to conditions lying between these extremes, the great middle class to
    which the prevailing upland vegetation belongs; and (4) the halophytes
    (“salt plants”), which are dependent on the presence of certain salts,
    and embrace such plants as are found on the seacoast, around salt
    springs, on alkaline flats, etc. The characters which distinguish the
    xerophytes from the hydrophytes and mesophytes have special geological
    interest, as they aid in determining the climatic conditions, a feature
    whose interest increases as the variability of the ancient climates is
    more fully recognized.</p>

  <p>Within these greater groups there are special minor associations
    determined by soil, temperature, topography, subjacent strata, and
    by the relations of the plants to one another.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> These natural
    groups are valuable indications of the agricultural capabilities of
    the districts occupied by them. They may be regarded as the outcome of
    Nature’s experiments in crop-raising, running consecutively through
    thousands of years. They are natural correlations of compatible members
    into communities of plants. Some members of the society are obviously
    dependent on others, as certain forms of undergrowth on the shadowing
    of the upper growth, as of vines upon supporting-trees, etc. There is
    probably a more occult relation in some cases, the effects of certain
    plants on the soil being sometimes advantageous to other plants, and
    sometimes harmful, as illustrated in the conditions that require a
    rotation of crops.</p>

  <p>The chief point of geologic interest lies in the fact that floras
    are not mere miscellaneous mixtures of plants that happen to live
    in a given area at a given period, but are organized communities,
    in a more or less definite sense. They therefore imply more or less
    definitely the physical <span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">668</span>conditions which are congenial to them, and
    thus furnish the basis for interpreting such conditions in the past, so
    far as the floras are well preserved. The faunas, especially the land
    faunas, being primarily dependent on the floras, furnish a basis for
    interpretations of like import.</p>

  <h4>B. <span class="smcap">The Influence of Geographic Conditions on the Evolution of
      Floras and Faunas.</span></h4>

  <p>The geographic features of the earth impose on organisms a complex
    series of influences which modify the evolution of life and produce
    faunal and floral variation on a large scale. The larger assemblages of
    life, which inhabit a continent or dwell in a great sea, are designated
    faunas and floras, as well as the smaller assemblages just discussed,
    but obviously in a broader and in a different sense. The disseverance
    of the land by the sea, or of the sea by the land, isolates the life
    and forces independent development. The introduction of cold zones,
    desert tracts, or other potent climatic belts has somewhat the same
    effect. So, measurably, does the raising of a mountain range or a
    plateau, or the sinking of critical portions of the sea-bottom.</p>

  <p><b>The development of provincial and cosmopolitan faunas.</b><a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>—If a
    region is isolated from other regions by the cutting off of all ready
    means of intermigration, as by the formation of an island from what
    had been a peninsula, or of an inland sea from what had been a bay,
    the flora and fauna are developed by themselves without much influx of
    other forms, and hence become local or provincial. This is usually more
    marked in the case of the fauna than of the flora, because the latter
    has more ample means of dispersion, on the whole, and so the fauna may
    for convenience be taken as the type. A good illustration is the native
    fauna of Australia which was once connected with Asia, but has long
    been separated from it. Previous to importations by man, this continent
    had a very peculiar and distinct fauna, descended from its Mesozoic
    inhabitants. Most of the isolated islands have peculiar faunas, but in
    many cases they were isolated from the beginning, having been built up
    by volcanic action from the bottom of the sea, and their faunas are
    due to the accidents of transportation and to the development of these
    sporadic forms in isolation.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">669</span></p>

  <p>It is evident that whenever any geographic change introduces a
    barrier to migration, the faunas of the dissevered portions will, in
    all probability, develop along different lines, and will diverge into
    provincial faunas. On the other hand, any geographic change that unites
    areas and leads to intermigration, tends to a community of fauna or to
    cosmopolitanism. These tendencies have been markedly felt all through
    the geologic ages, and constitute one of the most vital features of
    their history. When continents are connected, their faunas intermingle
    and the exchange gives rise to common forms. They tend to blend into
    one great fauna except so far as the local differences develop those
    minor assemblages previously discussed. When continents are separated,
    they tend to develop peculiar faunas, as do islands, but on a larger
    scale. This is very obvious in the case of the land life, but needs
    more special statement for the oceans.</p>

  <p>The oceans constitute a single body of water with ample connections and
    stirred by a system of constant circulation. Probably this has been
    true for most of known geologic time. A single cosmopolitan fauna of
    the largest type might be expected. This is in a measure realized in
    the pelagic fauna of the open ocean, though this is somewhat modified
    by the climatic zones. But the marine faunas that are fossilized in
    the known strata, and have most geologic interest, are, with rare
    exceptions, not those of the open ocean, but those of the shore zones
    and of the shallow seas. Now, although these shore belts and shallow
    seas are broadly connected with the great ocean body, and are usually
    regarded as a part of it, they are singularly separated from it,
    or rather they are singularly separated by it, so far as the life
    dependent on shallow-water conditions is concerned. To this life, the
    deep sea is a barrier not quite as effective as the land, but still a
    barrier. The key to this important fact may be found in a consideration
    of <i>the vertical distribution of life</i>.</p>

  <p>The great horizon of life is at or near the contact zone of the
    atmosphere with the hydrosphere and lithosphere. Life declines with
    increasing altitude, partly because of the lowering temperature,
    and partly because of the increasing tenuity of the atmosphere.
    The successive changes of plant and animal life with the ascent of
    mountains and plateaus is familiar. Life declines in descent into the
    sea chiefly from lack of light, and secondarily from the lowering of
    temperature. Light is essential to the formation of chlorophyll and,
    through it, of all other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">670</span> organic compounds. The chlorophyll-forming
    plants are, therefore, limited to such depths as are penetrated by the
    rays necessary for the photosynthesis of organic matter. Vision is cut
    off within 200 to 300 feet, and most plant growth takes place above
    that depth. Photographic effects become feeble or inappreciable at 1000
    to 1200 feet.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The photosynthesis of plants is chiefly aided by the
    lower and middle part of the spectrum, while the ordinary photographic
    work is chiefly done by the upper end, so that the photographic limit
    is below the photosynthetic limit. Microscopic plants are sometimes
    found lower than these limits, but they may have been carried below
    their working limits by currents or other incidental agencies. For
    all general purposes, the limiting depth of living carbon-compounding
    plants may be set at 100 fathoms, as a generous figure—about the
    average depth of the border of the continental shelf—while the vast
    majority flourish only in the upper third of this depth.</p>

  <p>Life does not cease here, for the products of this surface-life sink
    to greater depths and are fed upon by forms of sea animals that have
    become adapted to the dark and cold abyss of the ocean. Obviously,
    these deep-sea forms are a very distinct type of life, and constitute a
    fauna of the most pronounced kind, the abysmal fauna. Another distinct
    fauna occupies the open-ocean surface, the pelagic fauna. Still a third
    fauna occupies the shallow-water tract, whose bottom lies within the
    light zone—<i>the photobathic zone</i>—and embraces the animals that
    are dependent on the plants of this zone, or on its light and warmth,
    and that are more or less fixed to the bottom or confined to the zone
    because their food is there.</p>

  <p>The physical plane of demarkation between the surface or pelagic fauna
    and the abysmal fauna is much more distinct and more fundamental than
    any that is found in ascending above the surface of the sea. The
    habitat of the shallow-water fauna is limited below by the darkness,
    limited above by the water-surface, limited at one side by the land,
    and limited on the other side by the deep sea. It is hemmed in
    vertically between two planes only a few hundred feet apart. Laterally,
    it is confined to a narrow belt about the borders of the continents and
    to the more or less land-girt epicontinental seas. Its vertical limits
    are fixed, but its lateral extent varies with the relations of the sea
    to the surface of the continental platforms.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">671</span></p>

  <p>This variation profoundly affects the development of the fauna. When a
    major deformation of the earth takes place which increases the capacity
    of the oceanic basins, the water is drawn down into them more fully,
    and correspondingly retreats from the continental shelf. The shore is
    thus carried out toward or to the border of the shelf, or even perhaps
    down to some line on the abysmal slope. In either case, the zone of
    shallow water suited to the photobathic life is narrowed, and at points
    it may be practically cut in two. There are, however, shelves and
    tracts that were below the light zone before, which now are brought
    within it by the lowering of the sea-level. Into these, as into harbors
    of refuge, the life migrates so far as it may. But these tracts are
    less prevalent and continuous than the typical continental shelf, and
    under the conditions supposed they would be but imperfectly connected
    with each other by available shallow-water tracts. (The steep shelving
    shore tracts, although furnishing a shallow-water connection possibly
    available for some species, would be unsuited to others and, under
    certain conditions of the sea-currents, would be an effective barrier.)
    To these limited tracts, therefore, the life of the photobathic type
    is restricted and measurably isolated, and develops into local and
    provincial faunas.</p>

  <p>After a deforming movement has ceased, the seashore habitually
    advances, developing a new continental shelf, and in time new
    epicontinental gulfs and seas. In this it is assisted by the erosion
    of the continent and the filling of the sea, and probably by the slow
    settling of the continents. As the sea-shelf broadens, the isolated
    tracts, the harbors of refuge, become connected, and migration is
    facilitated. When the connection becomes general and broad, and when
    epicontinental seas have formed available tracts across the face of the
    continents, a general commingling of faunas follows, and a cosmopolitan
    fauna results.</p>

  <p>In the same way, but more obviously, when the land is extended and
    connection between the continents becomes general, there is migration
    and commingling of the land faunas and floras, and cosmopolitan
    communities are the result.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that the development on the land is the reciprocal of
    that in the sea. When the seas are extended and their life is tending
    toward cosmopolitanism, the lands are dissevered, and their life is
    tending toward provincialism, and <i>vice versa</i>. When, however, the
    land is greatly extended, it is usually accentuated by mountain ranges,
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">672</span> other products of the deformation which extended it, and these
    form barriers. Desert wastes and other inhospitable tracts, and even
    glaciation, are liable to develop as secondary consequences, and to
    interpose barriers, and hence the cosmopolitanism of the land-life is
    liable to be less complete than that of the sea-life.</p>

  <p><b>Restrictive and expansional evolution.—</b>It is obvious from the
    last discussion that if the picture of the earth’s movement above drawn
    be true, the areas available for particular classes of life may vary
    greatly from age to age. At times the shallow-water sea-life may be
    forced to retreat into a very narrow tract on the border of the land,
    and into chance expansions here and there. In being crowded into this
    limited tract, perhaps also less adapted for a habitat on account of
    the change, the life is subjected to severe competition and to hard
    conditions, and must experience in an intensified degree the effects
    of the struggle for existence. Whatever of evolutionary potency there
    may be in such a struggle under such restrictive conditions should be
    revealed in the modifications of the fauna that ensued.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, when the shallow seas are generally extending
    themselves upon the land and the land is being base-leveled, and
    thus adapted to shallow submergence, the shallow-water life enjoys
    an enlarging realm, and should reveal the effects of evolution under
    expansional conditions. In affording a comparison between these
    opposite and alternating phases of restrictional and expansional
    evolution, geology makes one of its great contributions to the external
    causes and conditions of organic evolution. These will come under
    repeated consideration in the historical chapters.</p>

        be called the source. A spring issues from beneath the surface and
        flows away in a stream. The stream is said to begin where the water
        appears at the surface, though in some cases the water of the spring
        was a subsurface stream before it reached the surface. Water escaping
        from beneath a glacier as a stream may likewise be considered a spring
        at the point of its issue.

      <a id="Footnote_273" href="#FNanchor_273" class="label">[273]</a> It is assumed that the direction of the supporting
        thrust at the periphery of the dome is at every point parallel to the
        tangent to the domed surface. This is justified by symmetry in the case
        of a shell conforming to the sphericity of the earth, and in the other
        cases it would seem to be as favorable an assumption in the direction
        of high supporting capacity as can reasonably be made.
